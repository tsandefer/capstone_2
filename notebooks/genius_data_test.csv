1593,"I can see
 Your defense mechanism is my decision
 Knock these walls down, that’s my religion","Lamar uses the term “religion” here literally. In 2013, he declared on-stage that he had recently undergone baptism. In many Protestant churches, baptism is a symbol of willing acceptance of the “saving grace” of Jesus Christ, and a public affirmation of faith.

“Knock these walls down” is likely a reference to the religious biblical story of “the walls of Jericho”, a story in which Israelites marched around the walls until they fell down through their faith in God.

Lamar has credited God’s favor as the reason he was able to escape his rough upbringing. He believes his career is divinely inspired, and that he was called to “a greater purpose.”

3520,"Though I wish he were here instead
 Don't want that living in your head
 He just comes to visit me
 When I'm dreaming every now and then (And then)","This verse follows a similar theme from the August 2018 Sweetener track, “R.E.M” where Ariana alludes to meeting a boy in her dreams:

Last night, boy, I met you, yeah
When I was asleep (sleep)
You’re such a dream to me, mmm, woah

Fans believe this is a homage to the late Mac Miller, who dated Ariana from August 2016 to May 2018 and passed away in September 2018. After he passed, Ariana struggled with feelings for him while she was engaged to Pete, which may have led to their breakup.

This line also sounds similar to Mac’s verse on September 2016’s “Cinderella,” a song he wrote about her:

You in my dreams, that’s why I sleep all the time""

This was even a line she tweeted in late 2018.

Grande has displayed a deep emotional bond to Mac.

1021,And just as I go to walk out of my bedroom door,"Eminem is watching a dream, but he converts the dream to his real life. As at that time he was the best-selling artist and was also at the top of the game too. He has mentioned the problems regarding fame in “The Way I Am”.

Eminem doesn’t get enough time for his family so whenever he tries to tell them that he loves them very much, his “Fame” and his alter-ego “Slim Shady” are such “Monsters” that don’t let him do this. He is busy all the time recording songs. There are also concerts in different parts of the world which he has to attend of course he cannot disappoint his fans. This was also a reason which caused problem in his marriage with his wife “Kim”.

Now he is in his bedroom thinking that he should tell his family that he loves them. As he goes to leave the bedroom, the dream he suddenly realizes that he is in a concert in Sweden, which once again brings the theme, the background and also the main point of the song is revealed here. He doesn’t change the dream himself, the dream changes around him. This is because he feels he has no control over the actions.

This is further explained in the fourth single “The Monster” off his 8th Studio album “The Marshall Mathers Lp2”.",19,False,accepted,1239,When I'm Gone,When I'm Gone by Eminem,35,1088937,1,"[""Yeah, it's my life"", 'In my own words, I guess', ""Have you ever loved someone so much, you'd give an arm for?"", 'Not the expression, no, literally give an arm for', ""When they know they're your heart and you know you were their armor"", 'And you will destroy anyone who would try to harm her', 'But what happens when karma turns right around to bite you?', 'And everything you stand for turns on you to spite you?', 'What happens when you become the main source of her pain?', '""Daddy, look what I made!""

Earlier in 2018, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson was exposed for cheating on his then pregnant partner Khloe Kardashian, Kanye’s sister-in law.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BfRnM46h4dH/?hl=en&taken-by=khloekardashian

Similarly, in 2003, former Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant was charged with sexually assaulting an employee at a Colorado hotel. He admitted to having sex with the 19-year old Katelyn Faber but denied assault.

Em incorporates wordplay on “battery” (cell/assault), “charged” (energized/accused), “connection” (electrical circuit/association) and “plugged in to” (connected/up-to-date). This echos his lines on “ShadyXV” from the homonymous Shady Records compilation album

Em, on the other hand, was sentenced to a two year long probation in 2001 for carrying a concealed weapon after he pistol whipped John Guerra, whom he allegedly saw kissing his then-wife Kim outside a nightclub.

He continues to ask, “Would it have been better if I had a song that said I was a ‘gangsta’? Or if I had a song that said I was a ‘pimp’? All those colors and patinas fit better on a person like me, right? But to say you are a god, especially when you got shipped over to the country you’re in, and your last name is a slave owner’s… How could you say that?”

900,[Part I: Produced by Sounwave],"Sounwave is a member of TDE’s main production group, Digi+Phonics, who also produced “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe.”

The production has an amped up feel—a change of pace from the majority of the tracks on the album. Kendrick explains his harsh realities over haunting string melodies.

About halfway through the song, the beat switch channels an old-school West Coast feel—the arrival of MC Eiht, one of the great rappers of that era, furthers the effect. Eiht, like Kendrick, hails from Compton, CA, and was a part of hip-hop group Compton’s Most Wanted.
Compton is also the hometown of rap group N.W.A. of that same era (late 80s-early 90s) featuring Eazy-E, MC Ren, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube and DJ Yella.

The second part of the song is produced by Terrace Martin and samples “Don’t Change Your Love” by The Five Stairsteps. He also samples the late B.B. King’s “Chains N Things” just after he begins the second verse.

2619,"Motherfuckers say that I'm foolish, I only talk about jewels (Bling bling)
 Do you fools listen to music or do you just skim through it?","All I know about music is that not many people ever really hear it. And even then, on the rare occasions when something opens within, and the music enters, what we mainly hear, or hear corroborated, are personal, private, vanishing evocations.

Jay-Z’s opening “Renegade” lines reflect the themes of the above, found in James Baldwin’s 1957 devastating short story, “Sonny’s Blues.”  In a situation similar to the drug-addicted “Sonny” in Baldwin’s piece, it is only through music that Jay is able to externalize his pain, confront his past, and muse on his current situation.

A topic of discussion that has been present throughout Jay’s career is how this street-smart emotional vulnerability has not always registered with, or been appreciated by, critics and listeners. Here Hov openly lambastes those in that category, suggesting that they are only superficially listening to his discography—judging it solely off tracks such as “Big Pimpin'” and “Money, Cash, Hoes;” while ignoring introspective cuts such as “Where I’m From,” “You Must Love Me” and “This Life Forever.”

In his 2010 autobiography Decoded Jay pointed out the target of these lines:

This also calls to mind lines off his song “Business”:

Can’t leave rap alone, the game needs me
‘til we grow beards, get weird and disappear

Gave him one thing he needed
What is this thing I pleaded?

2537,"And it's ten for the wolf and
 Three for the shepherd,","The Wolf and the Shepherd is one of Aesop’s Fables in which a wolf followed a flock of sheep for a long time, and did not attempt to injure one of them. The Shepherd at first stood on his guard against the Wolf, as against an enemy, and kept a strict watch over his movements. But when the Wolf, day after day, kept in the company of the sheep, did not make the slightest effort to seize them, the Shepherd began to look upon him as a guardian of his flock rather than as a plotter of evil against it. When occasion called him one day into the city, he left the sheep entirely in his charge. The Wolf, now that he had the opportunity, fell upon the sheep, and destroyed the greater part of the flock. The Shepherd, on his return, finding his flock destroyed, exclaimed: “I have been rightly served; why did I trust my sheep to a Wolf?”

3405,"Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time","Ariana Grande has discussed her panic/anxiety attacks, as well as feeling dissociated due to PTSD-like symptoms. Here, she talks about how it’s difficult to bring oneself out of these situations.

There are no one-size-fit-all solutions to attacks, dissociation or many common PTSD symptoms, much less anything like medicines or herbs. However, the most common advice, generally, is to breathe.

Ariana Grande told TIME :

Ariana has since revealed that therapy played a big part in her recovery. A common therapy technique is also breathing therapy.

Took advantage of my thirst to pursue

And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shined round about him a light from heaven.

Originally known as Saul of Tarsus, Paul persecuted early followers of Jesus until he was converted by God. God appeared to Saul as a “beam of light” and blinded him for 3 days. After he was converted, Saul changed his name to Paul and became one of the most important figures in early Christianity.

Kanye clarified on Twitter that the title The Life of Pablo referred to Paul and described him as “the most powerful messenger of the first century.”

A fresco painting by Michelangelo titled The Conversion of Saul is housed in the Cappella Paolina, Vatican City and depicts a “beam of light” coming down on Paul.

 Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)","Em starts a triple entendre here with “still put hands on you”.


The last thing you’re likely to add to a snowman would be some sticks for arms then some mittens or gloves for hands.
Before, Em makes a reference to beef (ground beef). Now he will “put hands on you""— common slang term for hitting someone—but specifically, he ""put[s] hands on you” in the way someone puts their hands on round chuck, when making burgers.
Watches have hands put on the face to tell the time. Hereafter, he starts a larger play on words about time.



“Stayin' wound up is how I spend time” goes with the time reference, and is also a triple entendre.


There are watches that, instead of running off of a battery, have a wind up mechanism.
“Wound up” is a common phrase meaning tense, anxious or fidgety. Em spends his time being wound up, or restless and anxious.
“Spend” is a homophone for “spin”. A watch being wound up is what makes the hands spin.

Just because some are living a destructive pattern does not make you a insane person(you can still control your thoughts). It just means we are scared to move out of our comfort zone and live a different lifestyle. New ways of thinking are scary to anyone until it is tried.

With the release of the 2017 Freshman Cypher and his controversially satanic verse, X has since been seen as the dark figure in rap. In an April 21, 2017 interview on the Complex talk show, Everyday Struggle, Joe Budden called X the Antichrist of the new rap age. Furthermore, X continues to stand as the face of depression and mental health in music, as well as suicide. X has also dealt with many jail sentences and criticism for his relationship with Geneva Ayala, his former girlfriend who he allegedly abused. Despite all the dark connotations attached to him, X feels as though he is still able to shine.

The terms “spotlight” and “moonlight” may also be direct allusions to the attention X has been receiving from the music community and media. It seems as though he is predicting the success of the album ?, as his recent single “SAD!” released before the album debuted at number 17 on Billboard Hot 100. In an 2017 interview, he outlined his aspirations for his future as an artist:

184,"Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
 Don't make me pull the toys
 And fire up the engines, huh
 And then they make noise","Continuing the theme of the verses, the first 3 lines have Kanye’s rich life on full display with an onomatopoeia of an engine sound to emphasize his car collection. However, he finally echoes the weeps from the hook and the other side of fame promised in the intro, as the closing line turns around everything previously said in the song. The confident braggadocio tone in Kanye’s voice is replaced by a mourning cry, announcing the rest of the album as a display of the sad part of the story, picking up where he left off on his previous LP’s closing track:

I turn on the TV, and see me, and see nothing
What does it feel like, to live real life, to be real
Not some facade on TV that no one can really feel

Of course, the more honest side of Kanye always manages to connect with the audience better.

In the Runaway movie, he’s driving a sports car during the segment this song is playing in. Interestingly, the car crashes as Kanye delivers the last line.

Referring to his cards as “toys” is another example of Kanye’s inner child as referenced in “Through the Wire”:

Even though the invite really was to check out clothes, I had told myself I was going to get on that album—whether he knew or not. [Laughs.] I’m not even a morning person and he wanted me to come at 9 a.m. I get there and I like his clothes. He’s like, “I knew you’d like this!” Then he started playing his album and I start humming and doing some little runs to what I’m hearing on the sly tip. I came in there humming! I knew what I was doing. [Laughs.] So he hears me and is like, “You can really sing. Yo, can you put some backgrounds on this song ‘Hell of a Life’?” He knew I was signed to Pharrell and all that, but I guess he didn’t know what I could really do. Like I said, we were more fashion friends. He just knew I was fly. So then he tells me to do “Dark Fantasy.” At the time it was pretty empty, just verses. He put me in another room by myself and said, “Go.” I came back with a whole intro and chorus. I did all the scratches and the cuts myself with my voice. That’s not a DJ thing when you hear my voice go like that. I was so nervous when I played it for Kanye. I hadn’t been in the studio for so long.

That we’d always be together through whatever
We said that no one would ever get between us

Since both versions come from Kanye’s point of view, this “argument” demonstrates his inner turmoil. There’s a side of Kanye that is over-the-top cocky, but also a “dark and lonely” side that makes him feel worthless.

These two hooks are Kanye’s version of a devil and an angel on his shoulders fighting for control, since the messages both contradict themselves. Vernon’s hook shows Kanye trying to convince himself that he is awesome, even though he knows deep down that he’s just a lonely loser.

At this point in his career, Cole isn’t following the rules that the music industry sets for upcoming artists. 2014 Forest Hills Drive had no radio songs and little promotion. In an interview with Sway, Cole spoke about building his fan base instead of creating a target audience.

I literally had to come to grips that this album might not sell, because we’re not doing this traditionally. And I didn’t have no singles, nobody heard any music. It was a scary thing for me, but I believed even if it don’t sell and ya’ll like it—cool. It didn’t sell? I came to terms with that already.

In previous lines, Cole spoke on his friend who wants to be famous and respected. While Cole not only achieved that, he placed his importance on other things such as family and music.

3152,"Now I'm the bad guy, call me Chun-Li (ooh)","Nicki expresses the fact that she could be seen as a “bad guy” for ruining her unfaithful boyfriend’s reputation after exposing him as a cheater. “Chun-Li” was the lead single of Nicki’s 2018 album, Queen, named after a character from the Street Fighter video game franchise. This also incorporates a line from a spoken interlude on Nicki’s track. which takes inspiration from a monologue in Scarface:

Oh, I get it, huh, they paintin' me out to be the bad guy
Well it’s the last time you gonna see a bad guy do the rap game like me

Like how Chun-Li was the first female character in Street Fighter, Nicki has been able to lay the grounds for the female rap scene, and remains one of the most influential women in the genre today.

The “Evil, spelled” adlib was added in post-production as a subtle jab towards critics who failed to notice some of the complex rhyme schemes from his 2017 album, Revival. Eminem addresses critics directly later in this track. The adlib itself rhymes with “evil spell” and notes that he spelt out evil – E-V-I-L.

Hamilton’s son and first biographer wrote this account of that final night:

[Hamilton] entered the room, gazed pensively at the boy, and asked if he would share his bed that night. Hamilton “soon retired, and placing [the boy’s] little hands on his own, he repeated with him the Lord’s Prayer.” The child then fell asleep in his arms.

2873,"Started from the bottom like a snowman
 Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that","Em restates the line that he used to start off the song, comparing himself to a snowman, only to take a different stab at it.

As a stand-alone line, “started from the bottom like a snowman” is a corny thing to rap (let alone to start off a song with). But Em is clearly aware of this and confidently recalls attention to the opening verse — which was actually a very clever set of bars building from “ground up” like a snowman to eventually “way in the sky“.

He is taunting his detractors who would dismiss the line as corny by furthering the snowman reference (snowmen are often decorated with a pipe), saying “put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that”, basically meaning “fuck you”, and if you didn’t catch the meaning, smoke some weed and maybe that will help.

A “corncob pipe” is a regular pipe, only replaced by a corn on the cob. This might be an allusion to Frosty The Snowman. In the popular Christmas song, Frosty is depicted like this:

Similar to the line in his version of “Odd Look” in which he sings:

All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner.

Abel is a clear-cut sinner, his lifestyle consisting primarily of drugs and sex. This girl represents purity, being untouched by his “madness” initially. The two are polar opposites and will co-exsist regardless of how well they get along. This is truly the beauty behind the madness.

Abel has been this character since the beginning and he convinces ordinary girls to fall for him so he can can “live life for the moment.” This leads to a constant cycle of give and take, as these “angels” are willing to give Abel everything they can while he only takes from them. He wonders if the two can live this way, and if so, for how long.

This could also be interpreted as being about his rise to fame – he loves his old time fans, but now he’s hoping that he can truly “live” and come into his own in the mainstream.

3171,"Damned if I do, if I don't (Yuh)","This line may allude to John Calvin’s theory of predestination, which states that your fate is decided long before you are born—that you are destined for either Heaven or Hell regardless of your actions during life.

Kendrick Lamar touches on many religious concepts on DAMN.. On “FEAR.,” Lamar receives a voicemail from his cousin Carl Duckworth. In the voicemail, Carl Duckworth says the following:

But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, ‘The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart’
See, family, that’s why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder

Kendrick Lamar seems to be applying a similar philosophy in this line. He believes that he is damned to Hell no matter what he does in life.

This line also concerns Lamar’s perceived popularity in the music industry. Though he has achieved major success, he is still a controversial figure. Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 release, To Pimp a Butterfly, touched on topics such as racism and police brutality in songs like “Alright.” Throughout DAMN., Lamar plays a clip from Fox News of two reporters speaking about the song. Here’s what they had to say:

Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote:
‘And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo’ sho'.‘
Oh please, ugh, I don’t like it

2923,I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin',"The use of the names “Demarcus,” “Marcus,” or “Mark” in this circumstance is not new, however Kendrick displays the connotation subtly within the context of “FEAR.”  Kendrick is implying that Demarcus, his “mark” (or target), rolled on him. This, in turn, exposed some sort of illegal activity on Kendrick’s part.

The connotation between the two words was additionally used in a verse from the 1996 track “Murder”, performed by Bun B of UGK.

Calling a person a “mark” was a very common insult some years ago, usually referencing a person being cheated in some way.

892,"[Produced by  Noah ""40"" Shebib and Hagler/Co-Produced by Jake One]","Jake One is the main producer on this track. He did the body of the work while 40 mixed and mastered it, and One thought it was a nice addition to it. One did a short “interview” of sorts on the making of the track and it’s sampling issues.

The jazzy, soulful beat is driven by it’s drums and piano cords. Drake brings it together to make this track, and the laid back vibe makes it’s easy to jam to. You can hear the piano drive it along with various other  effects and hits to make it a little more modern.

Jake One is credited using his “old school ways” on why he doesn’t tell where anything is sampled from, but that’s where the choir part is from, (until 40 had a live one done in Toronto). Gene Brown originally found that sample, and he has worked to find samples with a number of countless producers. Jake had talked and sent beats to Drake for years, but Drake finally said listening to it, “This is the one”.

There was just something about the dynamic of that band, in that church

Due to sampling issues, the track was then sent to G Koop who remade the parts with issues that night and resent it that morning. Then 40 added the finishing touches to bring it together.

In 2016, Drake tiptoed around Kendrick’s name again on “For Free:”

And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain’t free!

Big Sean, another possible target of these lines who also has a history of possibly sending subliminal shots at Kendrick, might have tiptoed around Dot’s name in his 2016 song “No More Interviews.”

2665,I can say that I’m attached to nobody,"A main theme throughout Abel’s discography is his indulgence in high sex with “no strings attached.” He is certainly not after love, and is able to be intimate with women without forming an emotional attachment.

This line is echoed in his track “Montreal”:

Baby I’m a pro at letting go, I love it when they come and go

 Ten toes to the ground

Kendrick’s original phrase “ten toes down” echoes the same theme of commitment, particularly in reference to a liberation cause.  Cole cleverly merges “ten toes down” with “down to the ground” by removing the common keyword  “down” which only amplifies his dedication.

When Phillip went to the theatre to challenge him to a duel, he was accompanied by Richard Price, a close friend of Phillip Hamilton.

Eacker’s duel with Phillip Hamilton was just a day later (November 23), in which Eacker killed his opponent.

BAQUET But will you have the same adventures in your life? Will you have the same stuff to write about? Or maybe you don’t know.

JAY-Z I think that rap in particular is a young man’s sport, that I’ll move out of that white-hot space. Rap is about the gift of discovery. The white-hot space is when it’s fresh and new, and it’s like, this is the hottest song ever. I mean I pushed the window, like —

BAQUET You still — you think you’re still in that space?

JAY-Z I stretched it. Oh, I stood in that window a really long time. But still, no, I don’t think people are looking to me as like, The Thing.

BAQUET Is that hard to deal with, or did you feel like, I’m O.K. with that, because I’ve moved on?

JAY-Z No.

BAQUET You don’t want to be.

JAY-Z ‘Cause I, at the end of the day we gonna find out it’s not about the white-hot space, but it’s about finding the truth. That white-hot space — people think it’s the biggest thing, but it’s really small. It’s almost like a trend.

Would you rather be a trend, or you rather be Ralph Lauren? You know what I mean; like, you rather be a trend, or you rather be forever?

545,Teamed up with the CCA,"Today, there are more African-American adults under correctional control than were enslaved in 1850, before the Civil War.

The explosion in the size of our prison population over the last 40 years rakes in billions of dollars a year for CCA and other for-profit prison companies. The United States has built up the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, with over 2.3 million men and women living behind bars. This is a historical anomaly; despite relatively stable incarceration rates earlier in the twentieth century, our prison population grew by 700% between 1970 and 2005, far outpacing both crime and general population growth.

And this overincarceration epidemic has a massive and disproportionate impact on people of color. If current trends continue, 1 in 3 Black men born today can expect to serve time behind bars.

Me and Kendrick found this crazy record from this foreign group and we didn’t know where to go with it. So we looped that, I took it to my spot, and did the drums. I added everything I needed, the extra guitars, strings, all that. That inspired Kendrick to bring it to another level. Kendrick is hands-on with [beats]. He will find something he likes and call me right up: ‘Yo let’s go check this out!’

The only sample used in the song is from the Boom Clap Bachelors' “Tiden Flyver.” The sample is at the beginning of the track in the sample and in Kendrick song:

He does this on his single “B.L.O.W.:”

Hate to be the reason
Why your dream bitches never get to see ya
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever?

In an interview with HipHopDX back in 2014, Tory spoke about how Drake helped to put Toronto on the map and the influence he had on the growth of his music:

I feel like in Toronto, we’ve always tried to have a particular sound, and I feel like Drake happened to be one of the dudes that paved that sound. […] I feel like [Drake has] helped me piece my sound together, and I feel like subconsciously, as an artist, you’re gonna take certain things from what you hear on a day-to-day basis.

However, once Drake got bigger and started separating himself from his Toronto peers, artists like Tory started to show dislike. Drake noticed this and realized Tory’s true feelings towards him. It goes to show that Drake will stick to his “No New Friends” policy and focus on his business.

They tell me “What’s done in the dark
Will find a way to shine”

Because Cole is not normally a querulous person, he allows time to expose his Demons rather than doing it forcibly. However, he also cares greatly about his pride which is in jeopardy due to his Demons. He discusses allowing Demons to exist at the expense of pride on “Motiv8”:

 Oh, you don't wanna clash? Nigga, I know","“The last nigga I know,” may be a shot at Jay Electronica. Jay dissed Kendrick in a video, calling him lame and his son. He refused to play his music and said he didn’t like any of it except “Cartoons and Cereal.” After Ab-Soul dissed him, Jay backpedalled and posted a video saying he would collab with Kendrick, showing he didn’t want confrontation.

Kendrick may have dissed Jay before on “untitled 7:”

I can never end a career if it never start

3092,I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune,"The “misfortune” he refers to is likely the impoverished circumstances in which he was raised, as he spent part of his childhood living in a Fayetteville trailer park.  Cole discusses such an upbringing in his 2014 interview with Music Times:

There were days when my mom would have to scrape up nickels and dimes to give me $1.50 lunch money,“ Cole said. ""And I would know she wasn’t eating lunch that day so that I could.

He transformed or, “flipped” such misfortune into a fortune, as his impoverished upbringing provided him with material for his music, but it also instilled in him a hunger to overcome the odds and make it in the rap game. While Cole never actually sold drugs himself, they were all around him growing up, hence the album’s drug and addiction theme. So it’s possible the “misfortune” he refers to is not just about being broke, but about about growing up around drugs and dealers, specifically. From this perspective, “flip” refers to the buying and reselling of drugs for profit. This is actually the 2nd time on this album that he’s rapped about flipping drugs, with the first being on the track, “KOD” where he raps:

So he is prepared to push it all to the limit, go too far, or too hard, even at the risk of losing it all, because he’s been there before.

For example, gossip pages have reported that Ariana’s “life coach” quit because of her selfish  attitude, and that her signature ponytail was actually a hair extension.

The word “bae” at the end of the verse hints that this may be about her short-lived relationship with Big Sean. Ariana is passionate about her career, and she doesn’t have the time or energy to maintain a difficult relationship. This echoes Big Sean’s account of their breakup. He stated that the relationship was somewhat one-sided, and that she didn’t want to put any effort into saving the relationship.

Either way, Ariana doesn’t let the negative opinions of others affect her.

baabyyy

Throughout the rest of their relationship, they both kept sharing pictures and videos of themselves on Instagram and Snapchat.

Ariana shared one final video of her and Mac one week after he unfortunately passed away due to an overdose.

On the other side, “Drip” is slang referring to jewellery or clothes.

The line was also teased on Grande’s Twitter a few hours prior to the release of the song.

Scientifically, the earth orbits the Sun due to the gravitational pull of the sun. Similarly, Ariana is inexplicably drawn to Mac – and can’t simply let go of him – even if he hurts her. Interestingly, lighter objects will always orbit heavier ones which is telling in this tale of toxic relationships.

I fought him on it the whole time. “I am not going to sing a grammatically incorrect lyric, help me, God!” Max was like, “It’s funny — just do it!” I know it’s funny and silly, but grammatically incorrect things make me cringe sometimes.

Mike Will made it, Gucci Mane slayed it

Gucci’s line gave Mike WiLL a lot of exposure, and eventually he changed his name to include the “Made-It,” and has since then used different versions of the line as his producer tag.

In early 2018, shortly after the release of Revival, a picture and some social media videos surfaced of Mike WiLL Made-It, Dr. Dre, and Eminem in the studio:



“Shady on the lyrics” refers to Eminem’s alter ego, Slim Shady.

 Nigga, ain't you rich already?""
 Yeah, but I got dumb as shit
 Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit","If Cole did go back to university, people would wonder why. The girl would say “Don’t you know this shit already?” because he already graduated (from St. John’s University, Magna Cum Laude). She would say “Nigga ain’t you rich already?” because he has already made it in the rap game. She thinks he should already know the material and should be focusing on his rap career.

He claims that hanging around with rappers has made him dumb. It’s a prejudice that most rappers are uneducated, but the fact is that Cole is one of only few rappers with a college degree. He feels like having lost the knowledge and intellect he had gained from graduating college, which is why in recent interviews you hear Cole say “I’m going back to college” with the intention to get smarter.

He certainly also understands getting smarter as an opportunity to enhance his lyrical abilities. He wants to write more songs with “smart” and “real” lyrics, instead of songs with “dumb” messages like “Work Out” only to sell records.

 ""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home","JAY-Z and Beyoncé, who have been together some fifteen years, often find themselves under the lens of the world media, and their relationship has regularly been beset by allegations of trouble and infidelity. This famously came to a head in 2016 when Beyoncé released her album Lemonade, which appeared to contain numerous references to her husbands alleged adultery.

Hov seems to confirm his infidelity here and numerous other times throughout 4:44. In the spirit of reconciliation, he concedes that it has taken him too long to offer his apologies—after all, the album dropped just over a year after Lemonade.

His references to Paris and Rome, both European capitals, underline the hectic, jet-setting lifestyle of a power couple made up of two of the planet’s biggest and most successful musical stars. It’s unlikely he is actually asking Beyoncé to join him in Rome, though. Instead, he may be indicating his longing for the strength he feels when he is happy and has his wife by his side; Rome is the historic centre of the Roman Empire, which seemed limitless in its

Lamar suggests that identity conflicts and a lack of pride are often corresponding conditions. He draws a connection between the positive development of Black pride/power and the potential personal/social/political revolution that can arise from struggling.

“Fit for a king” suggests that Jermaine’s home is luxurious. Perhaps a mansion, Cole’s house is fit for someone who can sing as large rooms absorb sound.

However, with a nice home comes a story of all the pain Cole went through to achieve it. From a trailer park to a front yard with trees in the sky, Cole had to work tremendously hard as an artist and producer to afford a home so large.

 Being indecisive makes me anxious","Drake is getting older, believe it or not. It’s getting harder for him to relate to college girls, especially those that can’t decide on a major. Think about it. Drake is 28. College girls are stereotypically between 17-22. That’s an average difference of 8 & a half years. And it’s showing. You can’t deny that when a verse starts with, “These days…” it has an “Ahh, I remember the golden days…” ring to it. Another point of relevance, Drake says he’s “anxious” and “nervous”, emotions commonly associated with older people. The young are wild, free, and indecisive because they still have time, but maybe time is becoming the one luxury Drake cannot afford.

His distinctly green outfit includes an accordingly green hat with a small red feather. It’s also worth noting that his hair is similarly red.

With this fame, he used his passion to help troubled teens and children, as he also discussed his goals for bettering his hometown community of Broward County, FL and Florida as a whole.

“It’s Spring..” spring is always referred to as a fresh start. Eminem is known for being meticulous about word placement.

Notice how the swing appears in every verse, but each time the scenario portrays increasing serenity:


In the first verse, Eminem doesn’t even have time for it.
In the second verse, he’s pushing Hailie on it but she’s expressing her unhappiness about Em’s absence in her life.
In this final verse, the swing is the final painting of a happy family.

Pusha’s starts acapella and then the beat is introduced. During Kanye’s verse, vocal cuts are added. In Keef’s verse several instruments are taken away. In Sean and Jadakiss’s verses the melody and drum kit are changed. The beat is trap-heavy with a loud sub, snare and hi-hat rolls.

The vocal cuts in Kanye’s verse are sampled from “Under Mi Sensi” (1980) by Barrington Levy, giving the song a reggae-influenced sound.

If I kill you now, will you go to heaven or hell you believe in?

Mortality is a common theme throughout X’s music. In a 2016 tweet, he revealed:

https://twitter.com/xxxtentacion/status/807784454055862273?lang=en

And on August 2017’s “Orlando,” he sings:

I’ve been waiting on death with a smile on my face
So this is the end

He also struggled with depression and had suicidal thoughts, which he goes in depth about on his first two studio albums, 17 and ?. However, he never had the capacity to go through with it, as he said on “777”:

Well, life’s a fucking uppercut
Right inside my fucking gut
Wanna fuckin' end it but
I don’t have the balls to
Fuck, I’m such a pussy, fuck me up

In this case, X has changed his mind and concluded  that life is worth living.

1225,"Swish, swish, how long they keep you in court? All day, nigga","Kanye’s had multiple run-ins with the law and has subsequently spent some time in court. His line from “Mercy” – “you gon' see lawyers and niggas in Jordans” comes to mind.

Incidents include; Allegedly assaulting an 18 year old man in 2014 for attacking Kim and calling her a “n****r lover”, the case was later settled for more than $250,000. Fighting with a paparazzo in 2013, which resulted in him receiving 2 years probation, and 250 hours of community service and 30 days of anger management. Scuffling with a paparazzo at an airport in 2008 – Kanye received 50 hours of community service.

Apart from his troubles with the law, Kanye’s use of “swish, swish” doubles as a basketball and drug allusion. While a “swish” is when the ball lands clean through the hoop. For most inner city basketball games, the winner stays on the court, so if you are making swishes – you could be on the court all day.

2598,"Throw a steak off the ark
 To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it
 Leave him in the wilderness
 With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it
 Take the gratitude from him
 I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa","These lines represent the mindset of young black males growing up in poverty stricken and crime infested areas.

Kendrick used the shark metaphor before on Dr. Dre’s 2015 song, “Deep Water,” a song that uses wildlife in the ocean as an analogy for gang culture in Compton:

They worry him to death, but he’s no vegetarian
The beef is on his breath, inheriting the drama better than
A great white, nigga, this is life in my aquarium

The idea is that the environment black males grow up in makes them more vicious than sharks.

“Ark” is another word for boat, but this could also be a reference to the story of Noah’s Ark in the Old Testament. Although Noah’s ark is about the obedience and faith of God’s servant, perhaps Kendrick uses the ark to symbolize wealth and privilege. If this is the case, the ark is home of the upper classes of society where people escape the “flood” of violence and crime that happen in lower class urban areas, which Kendrick refers to as “pool full of sharks.”

I shoot the lights out

Which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap with his deep voice complementing the beat. The song ends in a spooky, hoarse vocal riff delivered by Vernon, reminiscent of the track “Thriller”. An extended catchy vocal riff, closes the track.

The song heavily features bombastic tribal drums, and paranoia-inducing strings that create a feeling of tension. The beat of “Monster” has been described as a “hyperventilating death rattle”, the song was permeated with dark, urgent-sounding moans.

The line “I don’t blame you much for wanting to be free,” feels like an answer to Kanye’s bridge in both “Father Stretch My Hands Pt. 1” and “Pt. 2”:

Just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
I just want to feel liberated, I, I, I
If I ever instigated I’m sorry
Tell me who in here can relate, I, I, I

These parts are a back and forth between Kanye and “fame.” During his early days as a producer, all Kanye wanted to be was famous, but no one would give him a chance.

810,"So satanic, K-Mart chains panic
 ‘Cause they can't even spin back the curse words
 ‘Cause they're worse when they're reversed, motherfucker","The spinning back refers to the way tracks used to be censored, by playing the curse words backwards, which was a technique used by DJs, when they would spin the actual record back.



Eminem has always been a fan of referencing Satan, which he does several times on this album in tracks like Rap God. He even has a song that has a feature from “Satan” to represent his battle with addiction and fame.

His version of ‘Satan’ also references what drives his art. His muse. Shady. It’s rage.

The following line has a backmasked portion, meaning a part of the line is recorded backwards. Many conspiracy theorists believe this is a method of brainwashing used by the Illuminati to hide Satanic references in music. The reversed version of the line sounds like Eminem is saying “Rape your mother, kill your parents!”, and the original is saying “Shit, motherfucker!”

https://soundcloud.com/randyy/tihs-rekcufrehtom

K-Mart and other retailers that would sell the CD would be panicking because they have no way to hide the curse words in Eminem’s music here. It’s common to spin back (reverse) vocals in rap to censor out words without chopping up the rapper’s flow, but either way it’s ineffective on this track.

 Turned out, burned up
 You found me, through a heartache
 Didn't know me, you were drawn in
 I was lost and beat up","Like Kanye, Sia was living the “wild life”. During a rare interview with Billboard in 2012, Sia spoke about burning out as an artist and only wanting to write songs for others:

I got seriously addicted to Vicodin and Oxycodone, and I was always a drinker but I didn’t know I was an alcoholic. I was really unhappy being an artist and I was getting sicker and sicker.

While she beat herself up, her loss was her boyfriend. He died in a traffic accident while she was in Thailand, one week before they were going to reunite for a trip around the world.

Coming full circle, Sia is most likely referring to herself as the person “she found”. As per Billboard in 2012:

Things improved after a misdiagnosis was corrected and Sia was treated for hyperthyroid disease. Her medication was switched and she rested.

 I helped you out of a broken place
 You gave me comfort
 But falling for you was my mistake","Abel is likely referring to his ex-girlfriend, Selena Gomez, whom he dated for 10 months. During this period, he helped her through her battle with Lupus, even canceling a few shows on his “Legend of the Fall” tour to be by her side.

According to an insider:

Abel has been one of her biggest supports. She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery.

Gomez also consistently appeared on Abel’s social handles. For example, during their vacation to Italy at the end of January, she appeared on his Instagram story.

“On my way down” also has a semi-religious connotation that is echoed later in the song when Cole raps “we in hell already.”  One cannot help but think of Dante’s trek into the layered Inferno of the underworld, questing deeper and deeper——and this pseudo-religious interpretation is supported by the chant-like repetition of the main line …",25,False,accepted,93987,Crooked Smile,Crooked Smile by J. Cole (Ft. TLC),35,2390242,0,"['Even though I—', 'On my way, on my way, on my way down', 'On my way, on my way, on my way down', 'You were the one that was tryna keep me way down', 'But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round', 'They tell me I should fix my grill ‘cause I got money now', ""I ain't gon' sit around and front like I ain't thought about it"", ""A perfect smile is more appealing, but it's funny how"", 'My shit is crooked—look at how far I done got without it!', ""I keep my twisted grill, just to show the kids it's real"", ""We ain't picture perfect, but we worth the picture still"", 'I got smart, I got rich and I got bitches still', 'And they all look like my eyebrows: thick as hell', 'Love yourself, girl, or nobody will', ""Though you a woman I don't know how you deal"", 'With all the pressure to look impressive and go out in heels', ""I feel for you, killin' yourself to find a man that'll kill for you"", 'You wake up, put makeup on', ""Stare in the mirror, but it's clear that you can’t face what’s wrong"", 'No need to fix what God already put his paintbrush on', 'Your roommate yelling, ""Why you gotta take so long?!""', ""What it's like to have a crooked smile"", 'Even though I—', 'On my way, on my way, on my way down', 'On my way, on my way, on my way down (This crooked smile)', 'You were the one that was tryna keep me way down', 'But like the sun, know you know I find my way back round (Yeah)', ""To all the women with the flaws, know it's hard, my darling"", ""You wonder why you're lonely and your man's not calling"", ""You keep falling victim ‘cause you're insecure"", ""And when I tell you that you're beautiful you can't be sure"", ""‘Cause he don't seem to want you back and it's got you askin'"", ""So all you see is what you lackin', not what you packin'"", 'Take it from a man that loves what you got', ""And baby girl, you a star, don't let 'em tell you you're not"", 'Now is it real?

2026,How does a,"On the opening of lines of the show, Lin-Manuel Miranda said to CBS News 60 minutes with Charlie Rose:

Hamilton spoke in fluid paragraphs and he had density to his writing, and because of that the first line of the show is this huge run-on sentence.

Miranda has stated many times that because of this density and the sheer magnitude of Hamilton’s writings, hip-hop is uniquely suited to tell his story, as it can fit more words per measure than any other musical genre. In this way, Burr is prefacing what the audience’s ear will be subject to for the rest of the show.

This line is also the first use of a motif signaling major transitions in Hamilton’s life (e.g. in “A Winter’s Ball,” signaling his transition from bachelorhood to married life, or in “The Adams Administration,” signaling his transition from prominence and respectability to infamy and disfavor). In this instance, it signals his transition from a penniless orphan with no prospects to a new immigrant with nowhere to go but up.",67,False,accepted,2314493,Alexander Hamilton,Alexander Hamilton by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,46,4423104,0,"['How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a', 'Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten', 'Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor', 'Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?', 'The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father', 'Got a lot farther by working a lot harder', 'By being a lot smarter', 'By being a self-starter', 'By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter', 'And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted', 'Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up', 'Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of', 'The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter', 'Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned', 'Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain', 'Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain', 'And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain', 'Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”', 'Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland', '“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and', ""The world's gonna know your name.

332,"Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!
 Bitch, don't kill my vibe! Bitch, don't kill my vibe!","Kendrick is trying to chill – he doesn’t mind if you are around, just don’t fuck up his mood.

But to further this conjecture, this song hook is a complex revelation of Kendrick’s true psychology and the chorus is actually a declaration of his attitude towards the world.

Kendrick is a diverse person, and there are many layers to his personality. He is spiritual, accepting and thoughtful, but he also comes from a city of violence, drugs, crime, etc. Kendrick is an incredibly empathic person; he sees things from all points of view and thus does not fall into any specific classification but rather covers the entire spectrum of humanity. Because of his debilitating empathy, there is a slight distance between himself and his peers. He lives in his own kind of world, observing the behavior and the nature of everything and everyone around him and contemplating it to himself. He is sincere and stable and his ultimate quest is to spread peace.

However, a common tendency for people of this personality-type is to shy away from complex, inexplicable situations where no fair and amicable solution is apparent. When such scenarios occur they may try to retreat into their metaphysical bubble and escape the paradoxical anxieties of life. This is exactly what Kendrick demonstrates in this song (either consciously or subconsciously), and the phrase “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” is a solemn declaration of his desire to attain peace when things cannot be resolved easily.",210,False,accepted,90473,"Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe","Bitch, Don't Kill My Vibe by Kendrick Lamar",40,4317648,0,"[""I am a sinner who's probably gonna sin again"", 'Lord, forgive me!

2182,"If Jeezy's payin' LeBron, I'm payin' Dwyane Wade","This is when I felt like I made it in pop culture. Once Jay Z did it, I felt like I was on that respect level of artists that I respect. I remember where I was, I was with my guys and we were hanging out and somebody texted me like, “Yo, listen to this song.” So I listened to it and then when I heard it, I’m like, “Did he just say what I think he said?”

It’s a lot of different references and obviously Jay Z has his own. Some people from the street have a street reference to it. So I don’t really know. I just know Jeezy came out with that song about Kobe and LeBron, “23, 24” and then he came back and said that. So I didn’t care what it was about. I was just glad that my name was associated in a big song like that, for the city of New York. It’s huge.

You know, when you’re young, you put your name in songs. You’re like “Oh, my name would sound right, there.” So when I first got in the league, I was like, “If I could just get one big artist to say my name, that would be so cool. That would be dope.” And I got a few not only just mention my name, but really be punchlines in songs and I think that’s the dopest part of it.

1677,[Video directed by Jake Nava],"The “Monster” music video was released in June 2011, seven months following a leak of the unfinished product (which almost made Kanye shelve it). It features all four rappers amongst the midsts of sheer gore, primarily the corpses of white models – a potential stab at Ye’s then-recent ex Amber Rose. This could also be a satire of video vixens: instead of dancing attractive women, they’ve all been massacred. Lovely.

Directed by Jake Nava, best known for his work with Beyoncé, the video has been interpreted as a multitude of tributes to classic horror films such as Saw, American Psycho and Michael Jackson’s “Thriller” video. There are also some more obscure references to the character of Doctor Frankenstein and Bill Stoneham’s “The Hands Resist Him”.



The depicted misogyny and gothic style garnered a huge amount of controversy. The video was banned from MTV, alongside a backlash from activist Ann Simonton who started a petition to have it removed from online circulation. However, there has been some support for the piece.

His maturity will ultimately fail him, but for now he claims the higher road.

Secondly, he was about to embark on a campaign to “upgrade” his style and image. On The Black Album his track “Change Clothes” was pivotal in a culture shift in hip hop. At the time, he was saying “I am dismissing you and moving on to bigger and better things”. It didn’t quite pan out that way.

“The Way I Am” was one of the few tracks that I did completely by myself. I had the beat in my head before I went into the studio to lay it down. I had the rhyme and the piano loop all worked out. I had Jeff [Bass] play the loop and I finished the rhyme listening to my headphone set on the way to L.A. That’s why the flow is like that, cause all I had was the piano loop in my headphones. I wanted to do some different shit. I thought about the rhymes first. Once I got the third line I didn’t want the cadence of the rhyme to stop going with the piano.

1665,Tell Adidas that we need a million in production,"The demand for Kanye’s Yeezy Boosts released in 2015 was unprecedented, resulting in vastly inflated eBay prices for brand new pairs. During the launch of his 350’s, Adidas promoted an app as the best way to snag a pair. The only problem was, demand broke the app.

It’s been a constant struggle for him to set up the infrastructure to support such demand, and as a result he claims prices have been greatly inflated. This has been a barrier to growth as a fashion designer, with labels only interested in utilising his hip hop fame, rather than his design ability.

It’s very difficult if you don’t have that production and that experience that Ralph has, and it’s really difficult to get those price points, you know the Zara and H&M price points if you don’t got the factories, if you don’t got the boats.

“Little dudes” is likely an allusion to the rappers that use “Lil” as the prefix for their stage name. “Lil” rappers have become a common scapegoat for contemporary hip-hop at large. J. Cole made similar remarks on “1985,” as did Eminem on “The Ringer,” Kamikaze’s opener:

Kanye could also be quoting the aforementioned “people” and “his guy” who are telling him that he isn’t funny anymore. Kanye disagrees though… To prove them wrong, he tells another “joke: kiss my ass!

X & O have traditionally signified kisses and hugs, respectively. He repeats this mantra in “Power” – first to kiss his ass, then his asshole. It’s also a nice play on words, the “X” being the kiss and the ring being the “O”.

In the olden days of royalty, it was customary to kiss the king/queen’s ring as a sign of respect and deference to their sovereignty.

The track that is chosen needs to have a similar vibe, sound and feeling to what the artist is trying to accomplish.

With “collaborative effort”, Em refers to the controversial use of ghostwriters in hip hop. Ghostwriters are people who are not credited for making or contributing to a track, enabling the artist to take full credit instead.

Granddaddy had the golden flask, backstroke every day in Chicago

On his song “Sherane a.k.a Master Splinter’s Daughter” from that same year, he raps about performing better in bed when he’s drunk:

And I’m a professional porn star when off the Goose

This line is also figurative for the lengths Lamar will go to for Whitney Alford, his fiancée; he’d literally swim across the ocean for her.

671,"I can see why the fuck I disgust you, I must be
 Allergic to failure, ‘cause everytime I come close to it
 I just sneeze, but I just go achoo then a-chieve!","He has an allergic reaction to failure that causes him to sneeze when he comes close to it. Causes him to go Atchoo (At you) and achieve. Thus fulfilling/achieving his aims.

You can now also see why he disgusts you, because his allergy to failure causes him to go ATCHOO AT YOU. You better get a handkerchief.

Since his allergic symptoms consist of sneezing, the pause after the ‘a’ of the a-llergic is him about to sneeze (a…), but then he catches himself in time to finish the verse.

Achieve (here pronounced atchee) is also a sneezing noise.

It is also worthy of notice that the song ends on the same note it started with : “Being ill”.

During the main section there’s even what sounds like a dog barking sample if you listen carefully. It begins at a very slow 43BPM and pushes up to 120BPM in the main section.

Kilhoffer, one of the album’s producers, said

“I’m in It” started out with a different sample and melody. Then Kanye removed the sample, and it lived as a six-minute arrangement for a while. Then Rick Rubin got ahold of it and structured it to flow as a three-minute piece.

Mike Dean said

[The song] had these crazy guitar parts and all this stadium stuff, and then Rick, Noah, and Kanye pulled it back. I wasn’t very happy with that at first, but it came out really well.

It samples “Lately” by Kenny Lattimore, at the part where he says “a dream”. The sample is pitched and slowed down. You can hear it at 0:33 in the original.

…he was just little Jermaine

He listened to old Cole before he got a deal and realized he misses the hunger he had, like basquiat (that he mentions in the next lines), who didn’t paint the same when he got signed by Sony (well that’s a picture).

This could be a subtle reference to Nas' chorus from “Memory Lane (Sittin' in Da Park)"", as we know in Let Nas Down that Nas deeply inspire him in his raps. At the time of Illmatic (1994), Cole was 9 so he was still a ""Lil Jermaine.”

1762,"I'm tryna keep my faith
 But I'm looking for more
 Somewhere I can feel safe
 And end my holy war
 I'm tryna keep my faith","“Holy War” is viewed as a conflict between religions; however, among people of faith it’s more commonly used to describe the struggle between one’s faith in God and the temptation of this world.

When The-Dream talks about being safe, he doesn’t mean being protected against his enemies, he means to be protected against himself. He wants to stop the inner bickering between what’s right and what’s wrong and try to not being controlled by his egotistical self.

In short, he is looking to find his inner peace.

As the intro of “Jesus Walks” says:

We at war
We at war with terrorism, racism
But most of all we at war with ourselves

Between lines “Somewhere I can feel safe” and “And end my holy war” you can hear sample from Counter-Strike, precisely the line ““throwin' flashbang!””. It’s pretty quiet in song, but it’s definitely sampled.

“But I’m Looking for more” refers to the inherently insubstantial nature of religious faith. Faith is not rooted in facts or reasoning, but only in spiritual feeling.

Moments after Kanye and Ariana’s exchange, her ex-fiance Pete Davidson posted messages that implied he wanted to commit suicide.

Ariana was also called out for appropriating Japanese culture on the cover art and in the music videos for “imagine” and January 2019’s “7 rings.” Interestingly, she had to get her tattoo of Japanese letters covered after finding out it said “small charcoal grill,” instead of the intended phrase “7 rings.”

Finally, after releasing “7 rings,” she was accused of plagiarism by artists like Princess Nokia, who called her out for stealing the concept and flow of her September 2016 track “Mine.” Media and fans also noted the similarities to 2 Chainz’s 2011 track “Spend It.”

Ariana addressed criticism from others on her 2016 track “I Don’t Care”:

Despite his successes and the typically euphoric effects of marijuana, he can’t escape his depression. He contemplates whether or not he wants to continue living, echoing the sentiment of Hamlet’s “To be, or not to be” soliloquy.

If this song is from the perspective of Cole’s late friend, as so much of this album is, then these lines would link with the album’s closing verse, specifically the moment Cole’s friend speaks with him on the phone:

After releasing The Slim Shady LP in 1999 and The Marshall Mathers LP in 2000 – both received by some with serious controversy over lyrical content – Eminem waited a full 2 years to release Without Me as the lead single in 2002.  During those 2 year there were really no musical controversies worth mentioning, and it is this Slim Shady is referring to, with a sly grin no doubt.

Furthermore, music had hit a real lull in 2001, the year without an Eminem album.  Not just for hip hop, but in general.  The top 5 selling albums in 2001 were an aging Michael Jackson, Shaggy, ‘N Sync, Enya(!?) and Staind(!?!?!!).

2090,And they blame it on Marilyn,"It has been reported by the students of the Columbine Shooting that the ones who shot up the school (Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold) were fans of American rock band, Marilyn Manson (though this was later proven to be false.)

Since Rock & Roll was introduced to the world, there has always been the theory that music can persuade the type of violent behavior these students committed. The band has been known for it’s arguably reckless, eerie behavior, so it’s no surprise that the public eye held Manson responsible.

It is also possible that this lyric has a much deeper meaning, criticizing the media. When something as horrid as a school shooting occurs, people are quick to point fingers at controversial music artists such as Marilyn Manson or Eminem himself, for influencing a crime that’s completely indirect to them.

Eminem mentioned something similar to this on his song “Who Knew.”

He’s made it known that “XO niggas, ain’t nothing to mess with.”

2092,"I’m a little nervous, but I can’t show it
 I’m sorry, I’m a Hamilton with pride
 You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide","The first two lines of this verse are exactly the same as nine-year-old Philip’s, creating a callback. These next three are not exactly the same, but they’re constructed in parallel, with a similar structure of rhymes, repeated sounds, and antonym pairs. And yet the verse in this song is much more sophisticated and adult, with longer lines, more apt word choices, and better rhythm with fewer pauses and filler words. Compare:


I wrote this poem just to show it.
I’m a little nervous but I can’t show it.

And I just turned nine
I’m sorry, I’m a Hamilton with pride

You can write rhymes but you can’t write mine!
You talk about my father, I cannot let it slide!


The overall effect is: Little Philip has grown up. Philip only spends a few minutes on stage, so Miranda doesn’t have much time to make us fall in love with him. With five lines in “Take A Break” and five more here, he makes us feel the same mix of nostalgia, joy, pride, and love that Philip’s parents feel every time they look at him.

434,[Death to Molly],"In the “Bitch Don’t Kill My Vibe” music video, the string ensemble that plays during the outro is cut off with a black shot with the text: Death to Molly.



Molly is the purest form of ecstasy, usually given as a free powder or contained in a capsule. MDMA is consistently mentioned in contemporary rap, be it most humorously referenced by Trinidad James in the legendary:

Popped a Molly I’m sweating (woo!)

However it has also got artists in hot water, on Rocko’s “U.O.E.N.O.”, which features rapper Rick Ross, he rhymes:

Put Molly all in her champagne, she ain’t even know it
I took her home and I enjoyed that, she ain’t even know it""

Ross, who also remixed this Kendrick classic, has had his endorsement deal with Reebok dropped as as result of these lyrics.

Kendrick spoke on wanting to kill the Molly trend in hip-hop:

Sometimes you have the trends that’s not that cool. You may have certain artists portraying these trends and don’t really have that lifestyle and then it gives off the wrong thing. And it becomes kinda corny after a while. When everybody consciously now uses this term or this phrase and putting it in lyrics, it waters the culture down. So it’s really just time to move on.

2941,"I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity","Two of the biggest fears for an artist is the self-doubt of not being good enough to continue their craft and the feeling of not bringing anything new or original to the world. A 2017 article posed the question: “Is it Better for Legends to Burn Out or Fade Away?” The article specifically talked about legendary rappers Rakim, Nas, and André 3000 from OutKast—three of Kendrick’s Top 10 rappers of all-time, as he told Erykah Badu when she interviewed him in 2013 for Interview Magazine.

While Rakim is regarded as “the God MC” who influenced many rap legends that came after him, his ability to create hits through the 1990s faded when the tides of hip-hop shifted away from him as the genre was becoming more mainstream. Nas took the torch from Rakim in the ‘90s but he has millennials trying to fade him out by saying “nobody listens to Nas anymore” in today’s industry full of “lil” auto-tuned rappers. André 3000, on the other hand, has essentially burned out on making music and is semi-retired, saying the following to Complex in 2017:

I kind of like not being a part of [rap], now that I’ve done it. As I get older, I start to see myself move more back from it — the hustle and bustle of putting out an album, the pressure of being in the studio trying to come up with something. Now it’s more like a hobby for me, so I don’t think about it in that way. […] Do I really want to be 50 years old up there doing that? When I watch other rappers that are my age I commend them, but I just wonder where the inspiration is coming from. At this stage, I’m really more focused on what I am going to be doing 10 years from now, and I hope to God it won’t be rapping.

Kendrick wants to bow out of the rap game gracefully on his own terms but he neither wants to question himself nor would he want people questioning him on if he’s still got it in him to cultivate continuous creativity. In a 2018 interview with Billboard, Kendrick had a similar take to André 3000 on when he feels it’s his time to step aside:

It’s really always having love for it, and really having fun with it.

The track starts off with John Legend singing an introduction lasting a minute. The record’s production is lush and cello-driven with predominant piano. It has a very soulful sound while Ye’s lyrics and voice varies between angry and subsequently less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses Kanye’s forceful deliver and expresses hurt and contempt. At times like a ballad:

I can’t love you this much

West’s vocals are considerably distorted throughout the track, from naturally clear-sounding and ominously pitched-down as it pans left and right as they are sped up, slowed down, edited substantially, and altered in various ways, giving the song a ominous and brooding mood.

2707,[Verse 2],"In an interview with NPR, Mike WiLL-Made It revealed that Kendrick recorded this verse a cappella and asked him to build the beat around it:

With “DNA.,” he went the whole way [through] and then he just started rapping a cappella. He said, ‘I just want to see if you can put some drums around this.’ I said, ‘Man, hell yeah.’ But he was going so hard; that man was rapping so crazy. Just imagine him a cappella rapping the second half of “DNA.” and I had to build a beat around that. I didn’t want the beat to just sound like a regular boom-clap, boom-clap. I wanted that shit to sound just as crazy. I wanted it to sound like he’s battling the beat.

Also note that throughout this verse that you can hear someone shouting “gimme some ganja!” continuously in the background. This sample comes from the deceased American musician and composer Rick James performance of Mary Jane live, where he shouts “gimme some ganja!” on stage:

Cole criticizes the corruption in the police system as African-Americans are harassed, injured, and even killed for actions that are perceived as legal for other races. For example, in 2014, Michael Brown was shot to death by a white police officer in Missouri as a result of a confrontation based on Brown being charged with a robbery.

3143,"I put my hand on a stove, to see if I still bleed, yeah
 And nothing hurts anymore, I feel kinda free","This refers to the psychology behind self-harm. Whilst some people self-harm to punish themselves, others do it because they feel emotionally numb—they inflict pain on themselves in order to feel alive again.

“I feel kinda free” might relate to the euphoria some people experience from self-harm. When we experience pain, endorphins are released into the bloodstream, resulting in a natural high or a feeling of euphoria.

Kanye has dealt with depression himself and has been very public about how painful his mother’s death has been to him.

Went through, deep depression when my mama passed
Suicide, what kinda talk is that?



In an interview with Rolling Stone, soon after the release of the album, 070 Shake explained the lyric as a feeling of numbness to the sensation of pain:

If you burn it a lot, burn it hard enough, you will actually bleed. A lot of people asked me about that line: “Do you know what a stove is?” Bro, if you burn it for long enough, you’re going to bleed. It gets to the point where it’s so numb that you don’t even feel it. When it bleeds, it’s so numb that you don’t even feel it.

2555,"Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!","Kid Capri also dropped this line on “ELEMENT.”  It’s an adaption of the phrase “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,” but also alludes to the Bible verse 1 Timothy 6:7:

For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

Kid Capri also annotated this line on “ELEMENT.,” saying:

To tell the truth, I never asked Kendrick the meaning of it. I said what I said and I never asked him the meaning. He told me to say that part.

The most interesting detail about this line is that Kendrick considered titling the album “What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth,” as stated in an interview with Big Boy.

2783,My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay,"Mac Dre is a legendary rapper representing the city of Vallejo in the northern region of the San Francisco Bay Area. From maintaining his status as an independent artist throughout his career and recording albums from a prison pay phone to being a pioneer of the Thizz Movement and personification of the Hyphy Movement prior to his passing in 2004, Mac Dre had a major impact on the substance and style of the Bay Area hip-hop culture—as Bay Area rapper G-Eazy discussed in a 2014 interview with HipHopDX:

Mac Dre means everything to Hip-Hop in the Bay. Mac Dre is more than a legend. He just had such a big like catalog of these mixtapes and albums. He had so much music. So it was like, when Mac Dre really, really, really caught on, which was around the time he died unfortunately, that was when everyone really got swept up into it. He was the biggest force in the Bay.

Drake also paid respect to Dre on “The Motto,” which appears later in the Take Care tracklist—in 2016, Dre’s mom told Rolling Stone how these shout-outs inspired her to make a documentary on her son’s life:

I met with Drake in San Francisco and we sat down and he talked with me about how Mac Dre impacted his life and his career, what he’s doing and the big impact that Mac Dre had when Drake was a young boy. So listening to that, it kind of opened up my eyes that maybe I do need to do this. If Andre was alive he would definitely be capitalizing and making as much money as he could.

Whether it be Toronto City Councillors supporting Drake during the beef he had with Meek Mill, or Toronto radio stations playing him more than any other artist, Toronto always gives love back to Drake—just like Bay Area hip-hop fans supported Mac Dre.

611,In trouble waters I had to learn how to float,"Hov is referring to his rough upbringing in his early years. His childhood home was the Marcy Projects, and as mentioned in the previous line, he was a crack dealer. The Marcy projects are the “trouble water” where he had to sell crack to survive (stay “afloat”). Hov had to turn his life around, culminating in the 1996 release of his debut album, Reasonable Doubt.



Today, Hov is one of the most successful musicians/businessmen in America, with an estimated net worth of $500 million. He has ventured into the world of sports as well as clothing, has a stable family, and has certainly learned “how to float.”



Troubled water recalls John 5:4

867,[Verse 2: Eminem],"This song spawned the phrase of “renegading” someone. It was popularized by Nas – in “Ether”:

And Eminem murdered you on your own shit

That even though the song was for Jay-Z’s album, Eminem destroyed him on it or “renegaded” him. To be renegaded is when you feature someone on your track and they completely outclass you.

In an interview with Rosenberg Radio Jay Z admitted that Eminem had the better verse. His defense was in the essence that every dog has its day and that he has had the better verse on the majority of his songs. Blaming Nas for the phenomena that people wonders who murdered who before the record is already released and debate afterward who bodied who –  instead of just enjoying the song. He also admitted it in “A Star Is Born”:

His flow on Renegade, fucking awesome
Applaud him

Numerous artists, critics and fans have praised Eminems verses on this song – including Talib Kweli who called this his “3rd favorite Hip Hop verse of all time”.

The verse is exceptional as said by various artists and this rhyme scheme highlights the complexity of the verse.



In 2014 Eminem rapped this verse over Jay’s “Run This Town” at the “The Monster Tour”:

The saxophone melody carries the track, but the boom bap gives it a special hip hop feel, as if it is bridging eras. The message on the song is the focus, as Cole delivers one of his bravest efforts of his career as he tells the story of Nas hearing his first single, “Work Out.”

1832,[Chorus: James Fauntleroy],"I’ve known Terrace and a huge percentage of the people involved in the album for probably ten years now. That’s why I was even called. They just called me and asked if I would come by and sing on the thing. I went in there, came up with what I wanted to sing. It was just so natural. Did it really fast, got really high. It was unbelievable. I’ll never forget going in there and hearing that music. It’s one of the best albums of my adult life and of my career. It’s one of the best things i’ve heard and been a part of. For it to be so deserving and acknowledged by the president was an all-around amazing experience.

After this president, there probably won’t be another that listens to rap music. The fact that we have a president that listens to rap publicly, that he listens to this amazing album that should’ve won album of the year, and that his favorite song is my song on the album—it’s insane. It’s not an award, it’s not a plaque, it’s not a dollar amount.

1632,"(If you really believe it, gotta talk about it
 You heard about what happens when you talk about it","Cole has been very vocal about the recent struggle between African Americans and white policemen, and it’s possible that this line plays on that. His song “Be Free” is short but graphic; a famous man making a blatant, conscious, essential statement.

“Remaining silent in the face of injustice is the same as supporting it”. Yet when you do speak out, there can be deadly consequences. You may even be labeled a “conscious” rapper, which can limit your mainstream appeal.

But, as Tupac Shakur stated:

That’s our job, It’s to spark somebody else watching us. We might not be the one’s, but let’s not be selfish and because we not gonna change the world let’s not talk about how we should change it. I don’t know how to change it, but I know if I keep talking about how dirty it is out here, somebody’s gonna clean it up.

On a more surface level, Cole is probably expressing anxiety about sharing his goals with other people.

When you share what you believe with others, they sometimes look at you funny because they’re doubting you and that can lead to you doubting yourself.

Many detroit area and prominent MC’s in hip-hop speak about Em going into freestyle battle sessions, disrespected by many, but coming out respected by all, just from displaying his skills on the mic.

To go from that to being a hip-hop Icon is something nobody would have imagined.

 Never been afraid to talk about anything
 (Anything?) Anything! (Anything)","He has no qualms rapping about anything, no matter how offensive society considers it.

Both Jay-Z and Eminem have made many songs that either challenged social order or drew criticism for being downright offensive.

Examples include:
-99 Problems
-Mosh
-3 a.m.
-Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)
-Kill You

The way Jay-Z questions “anything?” after Em says “anything”, is an allusion to Jay’s song Anything. The chorus sampled in Jay’s song sounds just like Em in Renegade.
http://youtu.be/odThhIA2gUM?t=1m26s

 This line may also echoes the refrain from Oliver Twist in which the Artful Dodger reconfirms he would do anything for love.

Jay Z and Eminem are like the Artful Dodger – they’re devoted and would do anything and say anything. Like Em and Jay, The Artful Dodger grew up on the streets and had to make his own way.

It can also be read in the hip-hop sense. MCs in hip-hop use “what” as a way of amping up a song; it’s like saying “I can’t hear you” to get a crowd or rapper to be louder. Hamilton’s energy is relentlessly driving the story forward. He and the ensemble are the only people who say “what?” in this way.
