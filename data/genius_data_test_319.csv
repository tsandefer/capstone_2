the youth is never inspired to take a stand to make a difference. So I will speak for them. The youth, that is, the ones full of innocence. The ones inspired by the things around them, to matter.

He also took to his Instagram page once and posted the following on his story:

I wanna live long enough to look back at he things I’ve done, and say I positively benefited the youth or the world in some way

In January 2018, he started a movement called “#THEHELPINGHANDCHALLENGE” where he encourages young people to help other people in need. He even donated PS4s and musical instruments to Foster Homes, and claimed to have donated $100,000 to domestic violence programs.

Male genitalia is a symbol of power and dominance.

19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”

Rather, he should be more focused on repaying this person with love and blessing, as commanded to in 1 Peter 3:9:

9 Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.

In an interview with No Jumper, Cole shared his thoughts about religion, particularly Christianity, and some of his experiences with faith throughout his life:

It hit a point where I had to question it for the first time. I felt bad about it. I felt guilty …for even having a negative thought about it. I went and got baptized, started reading The Bible, and I was scared as fuck. Then it hit a point in my life where I just fell off and said, “I’ll let the answer come.” As I got older, I felt like I got a personal understanding of what God is to me, a strong belief too.

This is not the first time Cole has talked about God in his music, talking about it in songs such as “Change.”

Most niggas don’t believe in God and so they terrified
It’s either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got ‘em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)

1890,[Outro: Kirk Franklin & Choir],"Producer Derek Watkins described how Ye got Kirk Franklin and the choir to fly in from Texas for this song.

How many people in the choir? We’ll keep that private, we’ll call that secret sauce. So we begin to have a conversation in the studio. Kirk’s in there with headphones and he said, “What are you hearing?” I told him that we wanted to amplify what was already there. He began to teach the choir the parts and he taught it in seven minutes, bro.

Franklin recorded his part over the weekend. When he flew back to put the finishing touches on the track on Monday, he was already receiving criticism from the Christian community for working with Kanye.

Franklin defended Ye, saying “I will not turn my back on my brother…to a lot of my Christian family, I’m sorry he’s not good enough, Christian enough, or running at your pace…and as I read some of your comments, neither am I. That won’t stop me from running.

He came in one day and said he got inspired driving up the Pacific Coast Highway, on the way to my studio. He thought it would be a good thing to try the sample he found, so we tried that and the whole song changed. The chorus was still the old way, where it was sort of a band version. I took everything out of that and reduced it to one sort of ugly sounding synth. I would say the old version was more like MOR, R&B. That’s just an example of one song on Yeezus that changed a lot.

1543,There are so many to deflower!,"We all know what Burr has on his mind…



In 1860, an anonymous author actually published a sexually explicit biography of Aaron Burr—The Amorous Adventures of Aaron Burr. The book, though undoubtedly highly fictionalized, details a number of his alleged sexual conquests.

This would be fine if Burr, like Drake, lived in the modern world, where he would be free to please as many ladies as would have him. However, by 18th century standards, there’s a bit more going on here.

When Burr is talking about deflowering, he’s literally talking about taking away a woman’s virginity. While pre-marital sex was not exactly verboten in the 18th century—about one-third of colonial brides were pregnant on their wedding days—a lady was expected to marry the man who got her in the family way. If a woman’s chastity was lost, whether it was through a consensual act or rape, her reputation could be ruined.

As women weren’t easily able to retain property or businesses, most had to rely on their husbands or, more tentatively, their fathers and brothers to provide for her income.

Cole uses a similar phrase here, saying not to “hit” his phone, meaning he doesn’t want anyone to text or call him unless it’s about “commas.” This refers to large amounts of money, because a numerical amount in standard English is required to be marked with commas that separate hundreds, thousands, millions, and so forth.



Therefore, larger amounts of money will have more commas in them.

694,"Cause I'm such a dreamer, a believer in a sense","These two lines bring to mind an old song from 1967, “Daydream Believer” by The Monkees.

Cheer up, sleepy Jean.
Oh, what can it mean.
To a daydream believer
And a homecoming queen.

A popular interpretation of the song is events after the marriage of a daydream believer and a homecoming queen. Their relationship is unconventional due to different social statuses, but their love gets them through hard times. Sampha could be referring to a relationship with a woman, or a “relationship” with the industry and one’s career.

Another point of reference might be The Dreamer/The Believer, the 2011 album by Common.

I shoot the lights out

Which sets up the dark atmosphere of the track. The intro of the song is followed by a brief verse given by Ross, delivered in the rapping style of boom bap with his deep voice complementing the beat. The song ends in a spooky, hoarse vocal riff delivered by Vernon, reminiscent of the track “Thriller”. An extended catchy vocal riff, closes the track.

The song heavily features bombastic tribal drums, and paranoia-inducing strings that create a feeling of tension. The beat of “Monster” has been described as a “hyperventilating death rattle”, the song was permeated with dark, urgent-sounding moans.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSzPG0xMpLM&feature=youtu.be

He’s worried that Born Sinner will flop and maybe end his career.

He’s suggesting that part of the reason he’s worried is because he’s letting the Devil in him work, instead of trusting God.

On his Truly Yours 2 EP, Cole hints at the possibility of his album flopping with this line:

But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it’s back to the post office, both of us, shit
They’re saying that’s a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

These lines are also a great play off the previous verse, where he’s asking the devil for his soul back. In these lines he blames the devil for nearly derailing his career, as he said it was on track until he let the devil lead the way.

1412,"Last night I had a bad dream
 That I was trapped in this city
 Then I asked is that really such a bad thing?","Cole is saying that he had a dream that he was trapped in the city, but he can’t seem to determine whether it’s a good or bad thing.

The reason why he says this is because in his town they rob people on a daily, even for the smallest things, like a watch. So if he were to actually become something and gain riches he would be a target for being robbed and gunned down for his possessions.

2383,"I'm the type of nigga make the whole fuckin' trap lean
 Kingpin nigga, put wings on a crack fiend","A kingpin is a person at the top of some game; it could be referring to rap or crime, but the term most often refers to the drug trade. Presumably in comparison to a weighing scale, James can make the trap tilt (or “lean”) now that he has his weight up.

Cole describes the coke supply, which is high in both quality and quantity. The quality is great enough to make a fiend’s high feel heavenly. Meanwhile, the quality of the drug is so great that users figuratively grow wings, referencing an OD and obtaining angel wings from death.

 Almost what got Tristan single
 If you don't ball like him or Kobe

Earlier in 2018, Cleveland Cavaliers player Tristan Thompson was exposed for cheating on his then pregnant partner Khloe Kardashian, Kanye’s sister-in law.

https://www.instagram.com/p/BfRnM46h4dH/?hl=en&taken-by=khloekardashian

Similarly, in 2003, former Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant was charged with sexually assaulting an employee at a Colorado hotel. He admitted to having sex with the 19-year old Katelyn Faber but denied assault. About two weeks later, he bought his wife an 8-karat purple diamond ring, worth approximately 4 million dollars, as an apology gift. He was also caught cheating on his wife again in 2011.

Both of these men are talented NBA players and are extremely rich, which according to Kanye is the reason that neither of the women left them after these incidents.

3535,Forget about me (Ari-Chan),"Chan (ちゃん) is a Japanese san (honorific suffix) used to describe a child, close family member, or lover, and is used as a term of endearment. Ariana Grande shows appreciation for the Japanese culture by including this ad-lib, alongside using it on the cover art for December 2018’s “imagine”,“ and in the music video for January 2019’s “7 rings.”

アリちゃん (Ari-Chan) has been learning Japanese since 2015. She’s very fond of Japanese culture and wants to connect more with her fans. Additionally, in January 2019, she had to get a tattoo covered since it was supposed to say “7 rings” in Japanese, but instead it said “small charcoal grill.” Ayumi Furiya, her tutor, stood up for her in an interview with The Cut:

For “seven rings”, you’re supposed to have three kanji characters but she only got two, which makes sense because tattoos are painful.

“The reason I put out Bow Down is because I woke up, I went into the studio, I had a chant in my head, it was aggressive, it was angry, it wasn’t the Beyoncé that wakes up every morning.

Great, they don’t? they don’t. … But I feel strong, and anyone who says it’s disrespectful – just imagine the person that hates you, just imagine the person that doesn’t believe in you, and look in

2792,"I'll pass the weed to the pastor
 We all are sinners, won't you send us to bible study faster?
 Your hypocritesque reaction a blasphemy,","This line suggests that Kendrick knows the truth behind society’s lies. For example, the belief that all pastors are all around pure saints just because they’re religious is false. He knows that they too dabble in “sins” such as smoking weed.

Therefore, them pretending to be surprised at such a lyric would be considered “blasphemous” and quite hypocritical since religion teaches that people should be honest and forthcoming of their sins.

(Fun fact though: The Christian bible actually never directly states that smoking is a sin. It can be heavily implied, but it’s technically not stated.)



This line also connects to track 13 titled “Kush & Corinthians”—“Kush” being another term for weed and “Corinthians” being a chapter in the Christian bible. In the song, Kendrick discusses his moral conflicts within himself.

However, he can ‘drive off the fumes’ i.e. continue moving forward off the negative energy by using it as ‘fuel’ for his music. Graduation is far more introspective and self centered than its predecessors.

Driving off fumes is another also another way of saying running on empty, showing how tired he is from all the work he’s doing.

This is a continuation form the previous line where he says “he don’t even stop to get gas”. He doesn’t want to jinx his success by getting gassed up from all that he has accomplished.

Abel split with model Bella Hadid a few weeks prior to the release of Starboy, meaning these lines could refer to their relationship. While the two are said to still hold a great deal of love for each other, rumors also say their relationship ended due to too many scheduling conflicts, which isn’t surprising considering at least 40% of long distance relationships end at some point.

This could also allude to Prince’s Purple Rain single, “I Would Die 4 U”.

The homeless man’s empty stare pierces Kendrick. He becomes intrigued and doesn’t leave. As Kendrick becomes angry at the man, he articulates emotions of disrespect, anger, confusion – comparing his anger to throwing a baseball bat at the man’s throat.

This narrative paints a metaphor that calls to mind biblical parables, such as the story of Cain and Abel (“Am I my brother’s keeper?”) and
Matthew 25:45:

Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.

 Filet-o-Fish, Scribble Jam, Rap Olympics '97 Freaknik","Hellmann’s is a brand of mayonnaise and McDonald’s Filet-o-Fish is a cheap sandwich. “Mayo” is also a derogatory term used to describe white people. In fact, Charlamagne Tha God, whom Eminem mentioned on “The Ringer,” often uses “mayonnaise” to describe white people he thinks are racists.

Eminem is talking about advancing in his career. He went from being a poor dad to attending big time hip-hop festivals like Scribble Jam and placing second in the ‘97 Rap Olympics. The Rap Olympics was the turning point in his career, as a demo tape handed out during this event ended up in the hands of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre from Interscope Records:

Translation:


Leave the girls alone
Leave the girls alone
[or] One day it’ll be you they will leave
Leave the girls alone
Leave the girls alone
[or] One day it’ll be you they will leave

Yes, I cried, but on that day
No, I won’t cry
No, I won’t cry
Yes, I cried, but on that day
I won’t cry
I won’t cry


You should forget the girls, because one day they will forget you. He’s cried before, but now he’s cold to that kind of thing.

Stop playing with those girls' hearts, because one day, a girl that you truly love will play with yours. That day, the girl you tricked won’t cry, she will be rather happy that you’ve had a taste of your own medicine.

Then Majid—half of the OVO-signed duo Majid Jordan—laid some vocals over it while Jordan sped it up to infuse the track with more energy. They handed it over to 40 and Drake, and the rest is history. As 40 told the FADER:

Majid Jordan captures a moment that Drake and I have always been chasing.

This is a 100BPM song with a four-on-the-floor rhythm with a clap on every second beat for most of the track. The main arrangement is drums, synths, bass, vocals and backing vocals. It’s been described by SPIN as “synth-soaked R&B” meeting “slow-motion deep house”. The song uses a lot of reverb to give it a spacious feeling. During the final hook white noise cuts and hi-hats are added in to highlight the grand finalé.

Grammy nominated producer Chilly Gonzales broke down the keys used in the beat:

This gunshot ad-lib alludes back to the Chief Keef reference in verse 1. Keef made this ad-lib famous in his mixtape and song of the same name. This word has become a staple in many trap songs, as well as after shooting references by mainstream artists, such as Jay.

#OPINION #2
Not really, he’s alluding to himself shooting. People have used “Bang!”, making a gunshot noise, as an ad-lib before Chief Keef’s existence.

Both Jay-Z and Eminem have made many songs that either challenged social order or drew criticism for being downright offensive.

Examples include:
-99 Problems
-Mosh
-3 a.m.
-Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)
-Kill You

The way Jay-Z questions “anything?” after Em says “anything”, is an allusion to Jay’s song Anything. The chorus sampled in Jay’s song sounds just like Em in Renegade.
http://youtu.be/odThhIA2gUM?t=1m26s

 This line may also echoes the refrain from Oliver Twist in which the Artful Dodger reconfirms he would do anything for love.

Jay Z and Eminem are like the Artful Dodger – they’re devoted and would do anything and say anything. Like Em and Jay, The Artful Dodger grew up on the streets and had to make his own way.

She told me, ‘I want you to be you. I don’t want you to hold back.“ I said, 'You sure?’ She said, ‘Yeah. I want you to just be you and do you.’ I was actually in New York writing the verse. I recorded the verse in New York and she stopped by the studio. She was such a sweetheart. She was hyping me up, like, ‘Yeah, do your thing. Don’t hold back. Go in.’ And I said, ‘Okay, all right.’

Nicki also continued to describe her ties to Bey and her music in the past:

When I was putting out mix tapes and stuff, I would always remix her stuff. I have a dope remix that my fans have always been in love with, to one of her songs, “Sweet Dreams,” [that] me and Wayne did/ I figured that eventually we would do something together. I mean, I’m not gonna lie. Recently I thought it would never happen ‘cause I felt like if she was going to ask me, she would have been asked me. I think the stars aligned the right way.

1348,[Produced by Dr. Dre],"“My Name Is” was the first song we recorded. We recorded three or four that day, in like six hours. One song was called “Ghost Stories” and one was “When Hell Freezes Over.” I feel like there was one more but I can’t remember what it was. We always have this discussion, because Dre says it’s four.

Paul used to live in New Jersey, right across from Manhattan. He had an apartment he shared with three roommates. I was over, sleeping on the couch. We didn’t have money yet, really. We had already filmed the video, and we saw it for the first time on MTV. It came on really late at night. I was sleeping on the couch when Paul saw it for the first time.

That’s when it was like, “Okay, this isn’t a joke anymore.” We had kind of felt that, being in the studio with Dre and shit. But once that single came out, my life changed like that. Within a day. Just going outside. I couldn’t go outside anymore. In a day. It went from the day before, doing whatever the fuck I wanted to do, because nobody knew who the fuck I was, to holy shit, people are fucking following us. It was crazy. That’s when shit just got really — it was a lot to deal with at once.

Right after the first single came out, I did a signing at the Virgin Megastore in Times Square. While I was there, I got served by a court processor. They knew where I’d be, and they had to physically serve me. The guy got tackled. He was stupid. You don’t need to physically serve someone anymore, like in the movies.

2622,"Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 In another life, I surely was there
 Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
 I care, I care","These lyrics were actually written by Anna Wise while working with Steve Lacy. However, Kendrick reached out about using the lyrics.

Anna spoke about the collaboration during an interview with Complex in April of 2017, saying:

But for “Pride,” it’s really interesting because I didn’t even write that for him. I wrote that in a session with Steve Lacy where just him and I were together. Kendrick and I haven’t been able to meet up to work. I send him little, you know, voice memos. I’m always sending him little things just to be inspired by.

Additionally, Anna stated that she didn’t overthink these lyrics:

Often when I write, I allow the stream of consciousness to come and I sing whatever comes out. So I sang something, and then we listened back to it. Actually, what I sang when we did the demo is exactly what it is. We didn’t change anything.

The two have collaborated on many songs before, including: “Bitch, Don’t Kill My Vibe,” “Money Trees,” “Hood Politics,” and “​untitled 05 | 09.21.2014.”

https://twitter.com/annathewise/status/852687447674769408

It should be noted that, when the chorus is sung, both Steve Lacy and Kendrick space and drag out the lyrics to give it more effect.

Kendrick is using Anna’s lyrics here, which allude to the common saying that “sharing is caring” to relay that he cares about himself and others but cannot bring himself to share what he has, whether it’s his wealth, advice, personal history, or possibly his position in the music industry, all potentially to maintain his own happiness over flashiness.

The caring nature that Kendrick attributes to himself is likely exclusive to his God, family, friends, and fans, while his distaste for sharing may refer most plausibly to people he doesn’t particularly care for. With his own compassion in mind, Kendrick feels that if there had been a perfect world, he would have been apart of it in a different lifetime. Then, possibly considering the prideful nature of such a statement and/or reflecting on his distaste for sharing, he reevaluates and says, “Maybe I wasn’t there” in the refrain that follows, showing the humbleness that he fears that he may lose.

In another instance of apprehension to share, especially wealth (although Kendrick has engaged in philanthropy in the past), in his 2015 parable “How Much A Dollar Cost,” he refuses to give a homeless South African man a dollar because he is skeptical of the man’s intentions, and the man later reveals himself as God, leading Kendrick to repent and again, be humble.",119,False,accepted,3047138,PRIDE.,PRIDE. by Kendrick Lamar,24,1274934,0,"[""Love's gonna get you killed"", 'But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me', 'And you and you and you and me', 'And you and you and you and me', 'And you and you and you and me and—', ""Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care"", 'In another life, I surely was there', ""Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care"", 'I care, I care', 'Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldy possessions', 'Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?', ""The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em"", 'Happiness or flashiness?

2307,"These rappers insecure
 They talk about being a man so much
 I finally understand that they ain't even sure
 'Bout who they are and why they do this
 Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory","J. Cole may be referring to the success of his breakthrough single “Work Out” and the backlash he faced from his role model Nas.

In May 2010, J. Cole released “Who Dat,” which was supposed to be the lead single from his debut album Cole World : The Sideline Story. The song failed to achieve success in the charts, so Cole kept working on his debut album, trying to come up with better and catchier tunes. A year later, his label Roc Nation was finally satisfied with “Work Out,” a song that took a step back from J. Cole’s usual lyricism. It became the album’s lead single and J.

He initially served with the Jacobite forces of Bonnie Prince Charlie, and with the British forces during the Seven Years' War (Known today as the French and Indian War), but later became a brigadier general in the Continental Army and a close friend to George Washington.

General Hugh Mercer was born in Scotland. At the age of 15 he attended the University of Aberdeen where he became a doctor.  He served as an assistant surgeon and army doctor for the army of Bonnie Prince Charlie in 1746 and 1747.

After releasing The Slim Shady LP in 1999 and The Marshall Mathers LP in 2000 – both received by some with serious controversy over lyrical content – Eminem waited a full 2 years to release Without Me as the lead single in 2002.  During those 2 year there were really no musical controversies worth mentioning, and it is this Slim Shady is referring to, with a sly grin no doubt.

Furthermore, music had hit a real lull in 2001, the year without an Eminem album.  Not just for hip hop, but in general.  The top 5 selling albums in 2001 were an aging Michael Jackson, Shaggy, ‘N Sync, Enya(!?) and Staind(!?!?!!).

2126,And I thought I was so smart,"Burr considers himself to be a very smart man, and for good reason, but Theodosia is a revelation to him. The things he learned about the world and about himself, with the arrival of her birth, wouldn’t have been something he could have learned in books. He’s gained a new kind of knowledge and wisdom.

Whatever can be said of Burr’s pride and arrogance all fades out when he sees his daughter smile. Despite his flaws and shortcomings, his love for his daughter shows the audience that Burr is human and is relatable to modern day people.

Because everyone knows how the story ends (Burr kills Hamilton), Miranda struggled to sympathize the audience with Burr. “Dear Theodosia” is one of the key songs in Hamilton that helps the audience sympathize with the show’s antagonist.",14,False,accepted,2314546,Dear Theodosia,Dear Theodosia by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,19,780417,0,"['Dear Theodosia, what to say to you?', 'You have my eyes.

2899,"I been movin' calm, don't start no trouble with me
 Tryna keep it peaceful is a struggle for me","Although Drake squashed his major beef​, he’s no stranger to conflict.

Most notably, he beefed with Philadelphia rapper Meek Mill in 2015 over claims that he didn’t write his own songs. Drake responded to these allegations with his diss tracks “Charged Up” and “Back to Back,” after which Meek Mill eventually responded with “Wanna Know.” After Drake’s OVO Fest, where he performed “Back to Back” and showed a slideshow of fan-made memes that dissed Meek Mill, Drake was widely considered the victor.

Drake rapped a similar bar during his verse on Lil Wayne’s “Family Feud”:

2944,Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate,"Many drug addicts have been known to act irrationally when looking for money to buy drugs, doing things such as stealing other people’s items and selling those possessions alongside their own extremely cheap for a quick hit. An extremely desperate dope fiend could possibly even resort to murder if they feel that would get them what they want. Compton legend Eazy-E gave an example of actions from a desperate dope fiend:

He’s addicted, he’s a smoker but in Compton called a clucker
He used to have a house, car, and golden rings
But the cooky cooky crack took all those things
He must’ve been starving ‘cause he broke in my house
Caught the nigga on the street and straight took his ass out

940,"[Produced by Kanye West, Evian Christ, Dom Solo, Noah Goldstein, Arca and Mike Dean]","This is a very sexual song with what sound like porn samples, a simple sin/square bass, slowed drum samples and the same distorted one-shot from “Guilt Trip”. During the main section there’s even what sounds like a dog barking sample if you listen carefully. It begins at a very slow 43BPM and pushes up to 120BPM in the main section.

Kilhoffer, one of the album’s producers, said

“I’m in It” started out with a different sample and melody. Then Kanye removed the sample, and it lived as a six-minute arrangement for a while. Then Rick Rubin got ahold of it and structured it to flow as a three-minute piece.

Mike Dean said

[The song] had these crazy guitar parts and all this stadium stuff, and then Rick, Noah, and Kanye pulled it back. I wasn’t very happy with that at first, but it came out really well.

It samples “Lately” by Kenny Lattimore, at the part where he says “a dream”. The sample is pitched and slowed down. You can hear it at 0:33 in the original.

2871,"Still you feel the need to go full tilt
 That Bruce Willis, that Blue Steel, that true skill
 When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will","In the previous lines, Eminem states that he has nothing left to prove, and he has already done it all, but “Still you feel the need to go full tilt”, confessing his drive to keep making more music.

Bruce Willis is most famously known for starring in Die Hard, n action thriller series, which can be described as “full tilt”. Eminem has mentioned Willis and referenced the saga in the song “Welcome 2 Hell” as he engineered this double entendre:

Bruce Willis on his death bed, last breath with an infection
Fighting it while he’s watching internet porn
About to meet his death with an erection
My God, what I mean is David Carradine jacking his penis
In front of his tripod choking his own neck, what part you don’t get?
I’m saying I’ll die hard

Blue Steel is a movie starring Jamie Lee Curtis, released in 1989. It is also labeled as a suspenseful thriller, and can be described as “full tilt”. Eminem has mentioned Curtis before in “No Favors” when he said;

They blame me for murdering Jamie Lee Curtis
Said I put her face in the furnace, beat her with a space heater
A piece of furniture, egg beater, thermos

After referencing his “true skill”, he adds, “When that wheel’s loose, I won’t lose will”, meaning that, even if he isn’t 100% (not all wheels are bolted on tightly), he wont lose will.  Em includes a play on words with “loose wheel” and “lose will”, reversing the order of words with similar pronunciation.

Finally, he ends a verse full of poker references (“ace in the hole”, “use the cards you’re dealt”, “stacked decks”) with a last one: Going “full tilt” in the professional world of poker is a term meaning to play aggressive and reckless right after losing a big hand.",37,False,accepted,3350675,Believe,Believe by Eminem,38,796129,0,"['And I started from the bottom', 'Like a snowman—ground-up',

825,[Produced by DJ Toomp and Kanye West],"The song contains audio samples of ad-libs provided by Young Jeezy as well as background vocals provided by Connie Mitchell of the Australian electronic group Sneaky Sound System.  The drum track which uniquely uses the ride cymbal was laid down by DJ Troomp and upon first listen you know the driving crescendo of beats were made to be echoed loud and clear through an arena venue. In an interview, West further discusses the finer point of the song’s arena rock like qualities.

I hear records that are super hot for two months, but the records won’t last in people’s minds. I set out not to just make records that could hop off the radio instantly, but stuff that will speak to people. People still bring up ‘Spaceships’ to me. And people compare ‘Can’t Tell Me Nothing’ to ‘Spaceships’ saying that’s a song that inspires them when they going to work. But the chords itself, is like a Led Zeppelin rock melody. Yeah, you thinking it’s made for the car and you thinking it’s made for the club, and it works in the arena because DJ Toomp did the drums and all that, but the actual melody is made to rock 50,000 people.

639,[Verse 3: Kanye West],"Kanye’s verse, rather than being about cementing his place at the top, is about how it feels to be there, and the good and the bad about it (something he was pondering a lot around the time of this song’s release – hence 808s and Heartbreak).

To help paint the medium for his lyrics, he lets the beat switch out for a bit to a more laid-back, melodic soundscape for the first part of his verse.

1527,You never learned to take your time!,"This line references Chernow’s biography. Remember Hugh Knox, the preacher that took Hamilton under his wing in St. Croix?

An avuncular man with a droll wit, Knox worried that Hamilton was too driven and prone to overwork, too eager to compensate for lost time—a failing, if it was one, that he never outgrew. In later years, Knox [remembered to] Hamilton that he had been “rather delicate & frail,” with an “ambition to excel,” and had tended to “strain every nerve"" to be the very best at what he was doing.

Hamilton’s tendency to overwork and write like he’s running out of time will follow him throughout his life, and this musical, intensifying with each loss; we already saw this happen after he lost his mother earlier in the song, and we’ll see it again in “Non-Stop” after losing Laurens.

There’s a striking musical emphasis here, foreshadowing the company refrain of “Time” that will become so important in the show’s final song.

In the original version of this song from “The Hamilton Mixtape,” the line was instead ‘you always had to speak your mind.’ It’s likely the line was changed to anticipate the theme of Hamilton “running out of of time” which emerged in later songs.",27,False,accepted,2314493,Alexander Hamilton,Alexander Hamilton by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,46,4423104,0,"['How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a', 'Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten', 'Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor', 'Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?', 'The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father', 'Got a lot farther by working a lot harder', 'By being a lot smarter', 'By being a self-starter', 'By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter', 'And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted', 'Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up', 'Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of', 'The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter', 'Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned', 'Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain', 'Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain', 'And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain', 'Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”', 'Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland', '“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and', ""The world's gonna know your name.

Abel is indoctrinating a girl into his lifestyle, which is a constant juggling of sex and drugs. She loves him, but ironically, he doesn’t really have a heart to provide her. What he does have, however, is a big crew, a crew that his girl must meet if she wants to be anything to Abel.

The implications of these lines embody the entire interpretation of the track:


His girl may have to meet and get approval from the entire XO group, which may include getting fucked by them all. Abel’s made it clear that he doesn’t mind sharing on several occasions. Nothing is a commitment for him.
The “boys” could also metaphorically refer to Abel’s assortment of drugs.

The original song mentions things such as “beating your competition” and being the best lyricist:

Try to be the phattest is the level that we strive. Try to be the phattest also to stay alive

These artists could even be people record labels coerce into recording music that sounds like The Weeknd’s in order to appropriate his sound.

 Like an evil spell, I'm E-V-I-L (Evil, spelled)","Before modern medicine, physicians would hold mirrors to the human mouth and look for fog to determine if a person was still breathing.



The “Evil, spelled” adlib was added in post-production as a subtle jab towards critics who failed to notice some of the complex rhyme schemes from his 2017 album, Revival. Eminem addresses critics directly later in this track. The adlib itself rhymes with “evil spell” and notes that he spelt out evil – E-V-I-L.

Earlier on this track, Em spoon fed listeners a pun in a similar fashion:

This is also a key change in his life, a con of fame if you will, as, in “Rescue You”, he says

You had a long day, I can tell by your face

and then, in “Enemy”, he says

Girl, I been drinkin' all day
Its been a long week,
Can’t you tell by my face?

“Enemy” was released after House Of Balloons, Thursday and Echoes Of Silence, and since he’s had to start making music for a living, this clearly shows that the effects of fame are rubbing off on him.

On another note,

When Abel sings “ Last week was my rough week” he is referring to taking a week of pills/opiates.

 Oh, I was just playin', K-Dot
 C'mon, you know a nigga rock with you, bro","This could be a shot at Drake, who’s been involved in a subliminal war with Kendrick since 2013’s “Control.”

Kendrick mentioned Drake’s name on “Control,” but Drake has never put Kendrick’s name in a verse. However, he has subbed him on numerous occasions, including “The Language,” “Shit (Remix),” “6PM in New York,” “Used To,” “100,” and “Summer Sixteen.” The irony of these bars is the receiver is left unnamed, likely to leave the general public to decide.

In 2016, Drake tiptoed around Kendrick’s name again on “For Free:”

And like your boy from Compton said
You know this dick ain’t free!

Big Sean, another possible target of these lines who also has a history of possibly sending subliminal shots at Kendrick, might have tiptoed around Dot’s name in his 2016 song “No More Interviews.”

Sean mentioned “the savior of rap""—something Kendrick essentially refers to himself as on the same song.

But once pioneers like Run-DMC, N.W.A., Dr. Dre, and Snoop Dogg started becoming rich and famous off of rapping, it started attracting people interested in making money that didn’t rap for the love of the game.

Eminem is also talking about his personal life here. When he was underground he would freestyle with his friends and battle rap strictly for enjoyment, but now that he is signed he is making millions off of an activity he used to do for free. This sudden change is hard to wrap his head around.

Counting is a major motif in “Hamilton” and several songs feature a count, including the next song (“Satisfied”) where Eliza’s sister counts to three, “Ten Duel Commandments,” “Take a Break,” “Blow Us All Away,” and of course “The World Was Wide Enough.” There is even a mini-count in this song–“one week later… two weeks later…” Hamilton is constantly counting down to the end of his life.

 Yeah I feel you burning, everything's burning
 Don't fly so high

He warned his son to not fly too high or too low, but Icarus became enraptured by the beauty of flight and flew too close to the sun, which melted his wings.



Vic uses this as a warning – if you become too caught up in something potentially harmful, it will come back to bite you.

Similar to the line in his version of “Odd Look” in which he sings:

All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner.

Abel is a clear-cut sinner, his lifestyle consisting primarily of drugs and sex. This girl represents purity, being untouched by his “madness” initially. The two are polar opposites and will co-exsist regardless of how well they get along. This is truly the beauty behind the madness.

Abel has been this character since the beginning and he convinces ordinary girls to fall for him so he can can “live life for the moment.” This leads to a constant cycle of give and take, as these “angels” are willing to give Abel everything they can while he only takes from them. He wonders if the two can live this way, and if so, for how long.

This could also be interpreted as being about his rise to fame – he loves his old time fans, but now he’s hoping that he can truly “live” and come into his own in the mainstream.

His tone indicates an attempt at reassuring the audience that he’s not doing anything “serious,” and he further rejects concern by noting he doesn’t care about those who are worrying about him.

 Lift","This sample comes from Amnesty’s 1973 track, “Liberty.”

The use of this sample was likely inspired by Kanye’s recent politically-charged tweets.

It could also allude to the concept of “lifting oneself up by the bootstraps”—a term prevalent in modern Republican rhetoric, as a counter to advocates of government welfare. The term has been heavily criticized in the political sphere due to its naive worldview. In addition, “Liberty” was featured on Amnesty’s 1973 album, Free Your Mind. This could tie in with Kanye’s support for “free thinkers.”

https://soundcloud.com/blackdreamer-1/cruel-cold-winter

Although Ye only ended up using the intro (before any drums, vocals, etc come in), Bronfman was pleased with the final result, saying:

He almost accentuated the track more, the only part he took was the beginning part – he made it even more minimalistic.

It should be noted that the first time Bronfman heard any version of “New Slaves” was a month before the album release, on May 15th at the Adult Swim show at Roseland Ballroom.

The original sample for both tracks stems from the 1976 Soul Dog song, “Can’t Stop Loving You.” The producers mainly loop the first chords of the song, sprinkling in other aspects of the instrumental throughout.

Interestingly enough, Kanye had already sampled Soul Dog’s “Can’t Stop Loving You” fifteen years ago on The Madd Rapper’s “Not The One.” Looks like Ye owes Carl Mashall at least two songs!

1530,Alexander Hamilton!,"The first number sets a lot of precedent for the show, as mentioned in the summary. One of the more interesting elements is the way in which the show, particularly in “Alexander Hamilton,” is layered temporally; we’re in different tenses simultaneously in the show. It supports the sense of adventurousness, creative anachronism, and freedom that Lin-Manuel Miranda bakes into the voice of this work. It supports both the historiographical uncertainty and the playful multipresence that Burr & Hamilton (and the rest of the cast) will later explore (“The Room Where it Happens,” “The World was Wide Enough,” “Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story”).

We start with entirely past tense narration, giving the first decade and a half of Hamilton’s life via a chorus not really differentiated as characters yet, then we introduce Hamilton, and it’s his singular voice looking to the future—“just you wait.”

Once Hamilton has joined the conversation, the world has changed—neat categorization via tense and point of view gets more complex. Eliza hits two tenses in a single verse when she’s both recalling his childhood (past) and pointing us to the image of Hamilton in the sickbed with his mother (present).

We stick with straight past narration for a while until Burr (still not acting as Burr) puts him on the ship, again entreating the audience to see him in the present looking to the future. He tells Hamilton that in NY, he “can be a new man”—future, aspirational.

Then things get really wild. The chorus, in a delightful bit of meta drama, sings that they are “waiting in the wings for” Hamilton—speaking with expectation from the future to the past about farther into the future. They speculate about his legacy (a legacy they are in that instant touching, continuing meta riffs)—“when America sings for you, will they know what you overcame?”

Burr orients us again to Hamilton in the present aboard the ship heading for his (and our) future. He’s “comin' up from the bottom” as the company tells us “just you wait.” Then the players become characters, noting their relationship with Hamilton and summarizing their history (“I died for him,” “I’m the damned fool who shot him”). The company, though, continues to orient us to the future (of the show, and of the man), “just you wait.”

Burr brings us back to Hamilton in the present, asking him the fundamental question of identity—“what’s your name, man?”

The last line, then, is timeless. It’s identification. It’s aspirational and reflective, historical and personal. It’s pure, and it carries us into the more temporally-consistent (but definitely not locked), chronological body of the show.",82,False,accepted,2314493,Alexander Hamilton,Alexander Hamilton by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,46,4423104,0,"['How does a bastard, orphan, son of a whore and a', 'Scotsman, dropped in the middle of a forgotten', 'Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor', 'Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?', 'The ten-dollar Founding Father without a father', 'Got a lot farther by working a lot harder', 'By being a lot smarter', 'By being a self-starter', 'By fourteen, they placed him in charge of a trading charter', 'And every day while slaves were being slaughtered and carted', 'Away across the waves, he struggled and kept his guard up', 'Inside, he was longing for something to be a part of', 'The brother was ready to beg, steal, borrow, or barter', 'Then a hurricane came, and devastation reigned', 'Our man saw his future drip, dripping down the drain', 'Put a pencil to his temple, connected it to his brain', 'And he wrote his first refrain, a testament to his pain', 'Well, the word got around, they said, “This kid is insane, man”', 'Took up a collection just to send him to the mainland', '“Get your education, don’t forget from whence you came, and', ""The world's gonna know your name.

The two songs mirror each other; and, over the course of Beauty Behind the Madness, The Weeknd develops a connection between his emotional remoteness and  destructive behavior.

In Starboy, The Weeknd takes it a step further, thematically incorporating the effects of poisonous attention into his already addictive persona. The star of “Six Feet Under” is similarly attention-seeking, distant, hard working, and materially concerned. It’s in this bridge that he begins to explore the consequences of this deadly mixture: while she seems strong (“So she don’t waste her time /  So she don’t waste her time, oooh / You ain’t gon' catch her crying) the claim that she won’t ""lose her mind” is almost completely undercut by it’s conclusion: an ominous “til she” which becomes “‘til she /six feet under.”

She actually was talking about a hearing aid in that audio. She was talking about a hearing aid and how she can’t find anything to satisfy her. My mom was like, ‘You need a f*cking hearing aid,’ and Nonna was like, ‘I can’t! I don’t like it! I can’t find something to satisfy me!’ My mom was driving her crazy, so that’s what that audio is about. I was like, ‘This kind of applies to my life, so I’m just gonna stick it at the beginning of 'Bloodline.’

Grande is likely employing her grandma’s vocals here to express her own disinterest in long-term relationships. thank u, next is largely about her recovery after losing ex Mac Miller to an overdose in September 2018, and her failed engagement with comedian Pete Davidson.

X’s main cause of this numbness has come from a rough childhood, heartbreak, and events leading to him being accused of aggravated battery of a pregnant victim, amongst other related charges. His debut album, 17, is largely based off these events.

One of the biggest factors emotionally impacting Joey would be the suicide of Pro Era member and best friend of Joey’s, Capital STEEZ, who jumped to his death from the roof of the Cinematic Music Group headquarters on December 23, 2012.

X was, as of release of this song, under house arrest and had been for several months. With all the hype that surrounded him at the time, he was likely very frustrated and so those months felt like years.

The jazzy outro was produced by Terrace Martin.

Instrumentalists for the outro include: Ronald Bruner, Jr. on the drums, Robert Glasper on the keys, Thundercat on bass guitar, Terrace Martin on alto saxophone, and Larrance Dopson with percussion. Background vocals were provided by Lalah Hathaway, who was sampled earlier on the album, on the song “Momma.”

The liner notes also credit production duo Katalyst with additional drum programming and engineering.

In a 2016 interview with Noisey, Boi-1da details how he came to work with Kendrick Lamar:

828,"[Produced by TNGHT, Kanye West, Mike Dean, Arca, Carlos ""6 July"" Broady, and 88 Keys]","The samples? The first one that starts playing at the very beginning of the song is Nina Simone’s rendition of Billie Holiday’s song, “Strange Fruit”. This sample has stirred up a lot of controversy, due to the extreme depictions of lynching in the sample. The meaning behind this sample is further elaborated on in this annotation.

This isn’t the first time Ye used this Nina Simone sample. In 2009, he used it for Common’s “Strange Fruit”, which some believe was intended for Com’s album Finding Forever. One theory is that the sample didn’t clear, which is why the track never appeared on the album.

The next sample comes from electronic duo TNGHT (Hudson Mohawke and Lunice) in the form of a trap banger, “R U Ready”. This track doesn’t sample anything, but it does interpolate the melody and drum pattern used in C-Murder’s classic, “Down 4 My Niggas”. This is more or less confirmed by Ye referring to “Down 4 My Niggas” in the bridge. In 2012, Kanye bought “R U Ready” from TNGHT, and even played it at his appearance at the Victoria Secret fashion show.

In the official Producer Genius SoundCloud breakdown below, you can first hear the “Strange Fruit” sample, chopped, leading into the beginning of Kanye’s track. Next plays a snippet from “R U Ready” to enable one to hear the comparisons, and finally, “Down 4 My Niggas” and Kanye’s respective portions are played.

Obviously, this takes practice & skill as to not cut yourself, and not everyone has the ability to do this, which is why Joey can brag about it.

Joey here may also be referring to his rapping ability, alluding to how much damage he can do with his words alone, and how sharp his flow is.

This also may be a reference to a lyric on Nas hit “Represent”, in which he says:

This nigga raps with a razor, keep it under my tongue

2793,"I assassin my casualty
 And it's casually done, and tell 'em my salary come
 A lump sum of hundreds, don't talk to me 'bout no money","“Casualty” can be defined as a person killed or injured in war—in this case, the causality is, you guessed it, your favorite rapper.

Kendrick follows up saying he assassinates his victims with stating that he does it casually—in a relaxing manner with no emotion. This connects to the “whistling to the melody” line in the first verse. Kendrick kills off rappers so often that it’s nonchalantly fun to him.

When he’s done, he collects his profit or “lump sum of hundred” dollar bills. This could be in reference to the profit he collects off of his album sales; Section.80 would eventually become RIAA certified gold, selling more than half a million copies.

1756,If young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you,"Metro Boomin informs us of his involvement in this song with one of his many production tags; past ones include “Metro Boomin wants some more, nigga” and “Young Metro, Young Metro, Young Metro.”

The line itself comes from the bridge of Uncle Murda’s “Right Now” and is delivered by Future, Metro Boomin’s longtime collaborator. It gained prominence after appearing on Drake and Future’s hit collaboration  “Jumpman,” and even found itself in the political sphere, making its way into a Complex interview of former presidential candidate Ben Carson and protests of Donald Trump in Chicago.

In the weeks after this album’s release, use of this line in videos became viral, due to the infectious beat drop and jarring juxtaposition between “I’m gon' shoot you” and “Beautiful morning.”

Metro Boomin addressed the newfound popularity of his tag in an interview with Nardwuar the Human Serviette:

Kanye sympathizes with Chris’s motives, pointing out that power breeds temptation. Ye contrasts sophisticated supermodel Naomi Campbell with Stormy Daniels—an ex-porn star who caused an enormous scandal when it was revealed that President Trump allegedly had an affair with her while married to First Lady Melania Trump.

2538,"And it's one for the sheep who
 Led by your leopard, often gave his perception as a
 Handle of weapon,","The sheep is often referred to as an innocent, good-hearted animal in the Bible, as well as Christians following God like sheep.

X is talking about how a seemingly innocent sheep, symbolic of the average person, can be led astray into evil by a leopard, which could be representative of the more evil people in the world.

This is due to the things that an evil  life can offer in comparison to that of being morally strong are too tempting for the “sheep” to resist.
The leopard uses this fact to lure people into seeing things the way he does, hence his “perception” being his “handle of weapon”.

People know being evil may not be the right thing, but everyone has selfishness, one of the sins in Christianity, within them.

X may be saying he was once amongst the “sheep”, but a leopard, perhaps the devil he spoke to, led him to becoming evil and fulfilling his selfishness.

The leopard may also be a reference to Jeremiah 13:23. “Can the Ethiopian change his skin, or the leopard his spots?”.

 Burn","During the song, Eliza uses the term “burn” to reference the rise and fall of her relationship with Hamilton, changing the meaning of the word throughout the song.

She next refers to the tangible burning of the letters and his reputation in the eyes of the public. Lastly she says she hopes he burns, this time meaning his political career. It is also worth noting that Eliza was very religious and by the end of this song she is hoping Hamilton will burn and pay for his sins.

Drake constantly shouts out the city in his music, an example being the 2016 album Views, which contains a great deal of references to Toronto.

2165,I’m in dire need of assistance…,"On July 25, 1776, while the British fleet was gathering in New York Harbor, Washington wrote to Congress explaining that he desperately needed more staff members:


Disagreeable as it is to me, and unpleasing as it may be to Congress to multiply Officers, I find myself under the unavoidable necessity of asking an Increase of my Aid de Camps—The augmentation of my Command—the Increase of my Correspondance—the Orders to give—the Instructions to draw, cut out more business than I am able to execute in time, with propriety. The business of so many different departments centering with me, & by me to be handed on to Congress for their information, added to the Intercourse I am obliged to keep up with the adjacent States and incidental occurrences, all of which requiring confidential (& not hack) writers to execute, renders it impossible in the present state of things for my family to discharge the several duties expected of me with that precission and dispatch that I could wish—what will it be then when we come into a more active Scene, and I am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the same Instant?

Congress will do me the justice to believe, I hope, that it is not my Inclination or wish to run the Continent to any unnecessary expence. and those who better know me, will not suspect that shew, and parade can have any Influence on my Mind in this Instance.

About three years ago, Lamar was flipping through the channels on his tour bus when he saw on the news a report that a 16-year-old named Trayvon Martin had been shot to death in a Florida subdivision. “It just put a whole new anger inside me,” Lamar says. “It made me remember how I felt. Being harassed, my partners being killed.” He grabbed a pen and started writing, and within an hour, he had rough verses for a new song, “The Blacker the Berry”:

 Hi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?
 My name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady","Dre put on the Labi Siffre record, and I was just like “Hi! My name is!” That beat was talking to me. I was like, “Yo, this is it, this is my shot. If I don’t impress this guy, I’m going back home and I’m fucked.” I knew Dre wasn’t an easy person to please. I made sure that everything he had a beat for, I had a rhyme ready to go, or I came up with a rhyme on the spot.

“My Name Is” was the first thing that came out of my mouth that first day I was at Dre’s house. I don’t know if we released what I did the first day or if I re-did it, but it was basically the same. I didn’t understand punching, or believe in it. So I would just go from the top of the song all the way down. I was never flying in hooks. Everything was live, one take. If I got all the way to the fucking end, and messed up the last word, I’d be like “Run it back, let’s do it again.” I remember Dre was like “Yo, are you fucking crazy? Let’s just punch.” I didn’t like that concept because I wasn’t used to it. When we were recording here in Detroit, in the beginning, I was saving up my money to go in. We only had an hour, you know?

 Now let me see you","A sample from Lil Wayne’s 2012 “S.A.S.A.R.A.F.,” this lyric was initially not included in “In My Feelings” when Scorpion dropped. Previously, there was four seconds of silence between the chorus and the breakdown, before being updated on streaming services.

Producer BlaqNmilD added this sample after Drake mentioned that it would’ve been nice to have gotten Wayne on the song.

Around this time, the group must arrive at the loft. Abel tells the girl to shut the door before stripping as this experience should be an XO exclusive, or just between him and her.

 'Til you made up your mind

The Weeknd uses a pit stop as a metaphor to suggest that a girl whom he “put on top” had just used him for her own needs, almost in the same vein that a car refuels at a pit stop. He states that she had not actually been in love with him in the same way he had felt towards her.

This is most likely a reference to his relationship with fellow singer Selena Gomez. Selena and Abel broke up on October 30, 2017, after 10 months of dating; the very next day photos emerged of Selena reuniting with her former boyfriend Justin Bieber (whom she split in 2015).

His self esteem is so high (shooting through the roof) that its gotten his skin thickness to be bullet proof. He is in other words, way too confident for shabby criticism to even touch him. Notice the gun theme with the play on “shooting through the roof” and “bullet proof”. Could also link to the previous tool theme as a firearm is in slang also referred to as tool.

While the pauses in between the words may seem a bit odd, there is a possibility of there being further meaning in these splits. By cutting the word esteem and bullet and only taking the second syllable which runs smoothly with the rest of the lyrics,we can make more sense of the pauses.

NASA’s photographic evidence of the universe extends only 13.2 billion miles, as a result of the 1977 Voyager 1 mission.

And also “Get Me Back on Time, Engine #9” by Wilson Pickett.

These samples appeared often and early in the arc of hip hop production. The drums from “The Big Beat” were used famously by Run–D.M.C. on “Here We Go” in 1985 and by British rapper Dizzee Rascal a year prior to Jay-Z on his break-through hit “Fix Up, Look Sharp”. It was also featured on the popular Ultimate Breaks and Beats series.

The title and chorus are taken from Ice-T’s “99 Problems” from his 1993 album Home Invasion. The song featured Brother Marquis of 2 Live Crew. The original song was more profane and describes a wide range of sexual conquests.",14,False,pending,497,99 Problems,99 Problems by JAY-Z,40,959427,1,"[""If you're havin' girl problems, I feel bad for you, son"", ""I got 99 problems, but a bitch ain't one"", ""I've got the Rap Patrol on the gat patrol"", ""Foes that wanna make sure my casket's closed"", ""Rap critics that say he's Money, Cash, Hoes"", ""I'm from the hood, stupid!

Ariana’s December 2015 song, “True Love” and May 2016 track, “Moonlight” were written about Ricky. Fans have also speculated that the tracks, “Into You” and “Forever Boy”, are about him, since the tracks were released while they were dating.

And Chief Keef’s hook is displaying the effects of weed, as you can actually hear Chief Keef inhaling and exhaling smoke right before he starts his hook.

There’s a side of Kanye that is over-the-top cocky, but also a “dark and lonely” side that makes him feel worthless.

 Yes","Unlike Burr, Hamilton’s life to this point had not lent itself to traditional notions of civility. In Hamilton’s world, you needed to speak up in order to be heard above the masses. In Burr’s world, the masses were watching and listening to every word you said. This line serves to highlight how far removed Hamilton is from the world of polite society, and how ignorant he is of its more subtle arts. Burr recognizes that Hamilton is ambitious and wants to climb that social ladder, so, as his social superior, he condescends to share his philosophy for success with Hamilton.

However, in large part due to that upbringing of Hamilton’s, the advice falls on deeply incredulous ears.

The difference in their messages is echoed in their voices: Burr, smoothly and subtly explaining high-class behavior, sings his lines in a perfect, pleasing melody, while Hamilton’s lines are toneless and plainspoken. This is quite a change from earlier in the song, when Hamilton was rapping and rhyming while Burr was speaking in short, clipped sentences.

Burr not voicing his principles will become a recurring theme and conflict in the show.

This line is immensely important in modern day America due to police officers being guilty of killing many African-Americans.

Abel describes himself as a bird, a free soul and someone who can’t be held down, in this case with serious commitment. This girl’s bad for people like Abel who only want a one-night stand.

She makes herself appealing by attempting to live the lifestyle of Abel, his friends, and other partygoers. Abel will accept this in the short term, but can’t take her as more than a hookup.

In addition, Abel may be referring to this girl giving oral sex to a man, a practice in which the person gets on their knees to give the blowjob.",84,False,accepted,50236,The Party & The After

There were a couple months straight where I felt so upside down.

Apple Music originally had the lyric “her name is Ari” transcribed as “her name is Aubrey,” which caused a bit of controversy with fans who wondered if Ariana had a new lover or if she was talking about Drake, whose given name is Aubrey Graham. Apple later apologized for the incident and Grande confirmed the lyric was ""Ari,” as in herself, “Ariana.”

Lamar suggests that identity conflicts and a lack of pride are often corresponding conditions. He draws a connection between the positive development of Black pride/power and the potential personal/social/political revolution that can arise from struggling.

This leads into the next lines about police hostility towards Black people and potential retributive violence (“my gun might blow.”)",82,False,accepted,722278,Alright,Alright by Kendrick Lamar,31,2752208,0,"['Alls my life I has to fight, nigga', 'Alls my life I...', 'Hard times like, ""Yah!""', 'Bad trips like, ""Yah!""', ""Nazareth, I'm fucked up"", 'Homie, you fucked up', ""But if God got us, then we gon' be alright"", ""Nigga, we gon' be alright"", ""Nigga, we gon' be alright"", ""We gon' be alright"", ""Do you hear me, do you feel me?

This dynamic caused some house slaves to perpetuate and protect the slave institute. House slaves believed their lives were optimum, while field slaves hated their masters and wanted to escape.

“Quarters” is another word for “house.” Jay disassociates with any person who has a house slave mentality.

3487,I see death around the corner,"Lil Wayne uses this line to reference 2Pac’s song “Death Around The Corner” from his 1995 album, Me Against The World.

The term is repeated throughout the song and describes how 2Pac felt his life would end up (as the song was written during one of the darkest periods in his life), ultimately predicting his death which tragically happened the following year.

I see death around the corner

Both XXXTentacion and Tupac’s murders were similar in the eyes of fans and hip-hop commentators, with both being shot in their prime and in their cars. It could also be possible that Wayne is using this line and link to 2Pac’s to show how X also had a feeling his death was “around the corner.”

883,"Look who's back
 With a crab up his ass like a lobster crawled up there
 Two rabbits, a koala bear, and a ball of hair","Slim makes his entrance introducing the content of his ass : a crab, a “pesky pubic lice, that require treatment to remove, or they replicate and take over your entire crotch area” – U.D.



He then continues with the crustacean theme (lobster/crab), which is a reminiscent of his bar during the Redman collab' ; “With a hair up his ass like a rabbit crawled in his pants”. The next bar is also inspired from “Off the wall”.

For the “two rabbits” wordplay to be as he intended it, we would have to ignore the fact that technically, rabbits and hares aren’t the same thing.



Thus, let’s make an inventory of the things up his ass :


The metaphorical crab, sexual disease.
The rabbits/hares/hairs, rabbits being a notorious species of high reproduction capacity. “You two always be humpin' like rabbits !”
A koala bear, happens to be a ball of fur/hair, and also a “sexual position in which the male is on his hands and knees and the female is latched to his underbelly with her arms and legs wrapped around the male.” – U.D.
A ball of hair, a random third item up his ass to complete the theme.



All this to set up an animalistic sexual theme.

You can depict a story where Slim humps a chick in the koala bear position, gets crabs from it, and is left with pubic hair problems ; Slim is indeed back with a reminiscent of the Slim Shady LP:

Freedom is so entirely fundamental, that even if they do not have their other dreams, freedom is something that they can rely on so when they raise their glasses to freedom, they are raising their glasses to their only guarantee. These men don’t know if they will live or die; they don’t know if they’ll be remembered or just be another name in history. All that they do know is that they are free and that they will die free.

Abel, in regards to signing with Republic Records, explained on an open letter he published along the “Rolling Stone” music video:

I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for.

It’s very clear that he didn’t want to go mainstream but in his own words: “it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist.” Every amazing artist in history knew that in order to keep being relevant they had to evolve and experiment with their music—just ask Kanye.

1655,I love my sister more than anything in this life,"A bit of music theory terminology:  to modulate is to change the key of a song. In this stanza, Angelica reprises a melody from “Satisfied” in the original key.  Then, as her sentiment toughens, she modulates in line 3. You can hear she’s singing the same general melodic shape, but in lines 3 & 4, the pitches are higher than they were in lines 1 & 2.  You’ll also note that the interval is bigger after she modulates (from minor third to perfect fourth).



Additionally, Angelica doesn’t let Hamilton voice his opinion here: whatever he could say in his own defense doesn’t matter. She makes her decision about whose side she’s on without getting any input from the (sometimes) love of her life.

In short, Angelica has modulated the key without debating with Hamilton.
