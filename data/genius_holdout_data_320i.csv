 But the Devil don't play fair","This is a conversation between J. Cole and the Devil.

The previous set of lines explains how preachers would say Cole needs Jesus, but since he wants to be famous, he has to sell his soul to the Devil in order to succeed. Now, he’s asking for his soul back, but the Devil is not budging, telling him that he’s never letting go of him again. Hence Cole is heard saying “The Devil don’t play fair”.

Cole is suggesting here (as he was in the whole album) that he’s back from making “radio music”,  and he’s gonna keep making “real music”. It also fits in with the upcoming lines about re-adjusted his target audience and re-introducing himself, as well as the track “Let Nas Down”, where Cole is expressing that, when he couldn’t get a radio hit by sticking true to his lyrics with singles like “Who Dat”, he dumbed himself down and “sold his soul” with mainstream songs like “Work Out”.

Although “Work Out” was a success as a single, alot of Cole’s fans were let down because he strayed so far from the original Cole on The Come Up and The Warm Up. When he is saying that he wants his soul back, it can mean that he wants his real fans back, rather than his “radio fans”, and once he gets us back, he’ll never let us go again.

According to an insider:

Abel has been one of her biggest supports. She had been traveling with him on his tour and he was off during her surgery and right after during her recovery.

Gomez also consistently appeared on Abel’s social handles. For example, during their vacation to Italy at the end of January, she appeared on his Instagram story.

3281,"Call it trap 'cause it's a total setup
 Hopin' that you rappers fall in that","Eminem is using “trap” as double entendre here.

As has been widely discussed, Eminem disses an abundance of trap/mumble rappers on Kamikaze, including Lil Pump, Lil Xan & Machine Gun Kelly.

In other words, Eminem is saying Kamikaze is literal “trap” music for the trap/mumble rappers.  He is hoping that they fall into the “trap” and respond to his disses because he knows their responses will look weak in comparison.

Another interpretation is that trap rappers have set themselves up for Eminem’s “trap” by writing such terrible lyrics in the first place.

MGK could’ve already fallen into Em’s trap.

2945,"Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast","The expression “live fast, die young”—coined by Chicago writer Willard Motley in his 1947 critically-acclaimed novel Knock On Any Door—usually means to perform potentially risky actions you wouldn’t normally do in order to add excitement to your life.

This kind of thought is in the minds of many people (un)aware of their own mortality or those in a terminal situation who are essentially “waiting to die.” Kendrick talked about a situation where “The Art of Peer Pressure” caused him to move a little too fast while later thinking about the potential payback:

I could walk out there – there was one particular summer that was so hot you couldn’t even walk to the corner because the neighborhoods was feuding that crazy.

That is how crazy Compton is, you know. You are waiting on that corner, you pull up, they hop out, shoot at you down the block so that you could run the opposite way, and have another car waiting on you as soon as you get to the corner, and that’s it for you.

 Guess I'm included in that category as a nigga who done had the glory","J. Cole may be referring to the success of his breakthrough single “Work Out” and the backlash he faced from his role model Nas.

In May 2010, J. Cole released “Who Dat,” which was supposed to be the lead single from his debut album Cole World : The Sideline Story. The song failed to achieve success in the charts, so Cole kept working on his debut album, trying to come up with better and catchier tunes. A year later, his label Roc Nation was finally satisfied with “Work Out,” a song that took a step back from J. Cole’s usual lyricism. It became the album’s lead single and J. Cole’s biggest hit single to date, and is arguably what turned him into a mainstream act.

This song may have brought J. Cole the “glory” and recognition from a wider audience, but his idol Nas expressed dislike for the song and disappointment in Cole’s abandon of lyricism.

Of course, as a woman, telling a man to ""suck my balls” is also a statement of strength and masculinity. Whatever power this man once held, Beyoncé’s now taken for herself. She pays him no mind.

These lyrics appear to mock part of Jay Z’s verse on Kanye West’s “So Appalled”:

I’m fresher than you all, so I don’t have to pause

Saying “pause” after saying something sexually suggestive is a little meme in its own right.  The use of the term originated in Harlem as a way to dissociate oneself from something that could inadvertently sound like a piece of homosexual bawdy.

2611,"It's not a place
 This country is to me a sound
 Of drum and bass","The U2 segment is a sample from the 2017 song “American Soul” which appeared on the album, Songs of Experience. On “American Soul,” Kendrick returns the favor with some spoken word poetry.

These lines are broadly interpretable, but the song’s content suggests “drum and bass” represent gunfire.

Author and music critic, Steven Hyden, suggests the following interpretation in a close look at the collaboration, which emphasizes the themes in common with other U2 songs:

Bono’s vocal hook is an extremely Bono vocal hook, in that it seems to communicate broad truths without quite making literal sense… . Aside from the shout-out to his boys Larry and Adam, what Bono seems to hint at is a familiar theme from many U2 songs: Mankind perpetually feels dislocated in every way — physically, emotionally, spiritually —–which inevitably sends our eyes heavenward in search of guidance and, hopefully, deliverance. Later, Lamar distills this feeling down to a question: “But is America honest or do we bask in sin?”

“Larry and Adam” refer to Larry Mullen Jr. and Adam Clayton, the percussionist and bassist of U2. Bono’s reference to “the sound of drum and bass” is probably figurative, but it is also definitely literally referencing the song’s new riff, presumably played by Larry and Adam.",44,False,accepted,3047142,XXX.,XXX. by Kendrick Lamar (Ft. U2),26,4428467,0,"[""America, God bless you if it's good to you"", 'America, please take my hand', 'Can you help me underst—', 'New Kung Fu Kenny', 'Throw a steak off the ark', ""To a pool full of sharks, he'll take it"", 'Leave him in the wilderness', ""With a sworn nemesis, he'll make it"", 'Take the gratitude from him', ""I bet he'll show you somethin', whoa"", ""I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'"", ""I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'"", ""I'll chip a nigga little bit of nothin'"", ""I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap"", 'Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""', 'X-rated', ""Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'"", ""Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' (no mo')"", 'Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin', ""Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'"", 'God bless America, you know we all love him', 'Yesterday I got a call like from my dog like 101', 'Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds', ""He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk"", ""Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done"", 'He said: ""K-Dot, can you pray for me?', 'It been a fucked up day for me', 'I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome.""', ""He was lookin' for some closure"", ""Hopin' I could bring him closer"", 'To the spiritual, my spirit do no better, but I told him', '""I can\'t sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:', 'If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin\' killed.""', 'Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of', 'All the memories collected, moments you could never touch', ""I'll wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block"", ""I'll catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got"", ""I'll chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap"", 'Walk myself to the court like, ""Bitch, I did that!""', ""Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward"", ""I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours"", 'It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour', 'Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial', 'Let somebody touch my momma', 'Touch my sister, touch my woman', 'Touch my daddy, touch my niece', 'Touch my nephew, touch my brother', 'You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap', ""Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention"", 'Call you back—', ""Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control"", '(Pray for me) Damn!', ""It's not a place"", 'This country is to me a sound', 'Of drum and bass', 'You close your eyes to look around', 'Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph', 'The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives', 'Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters', 'Barricaded blocks and borders', 'Look what you taught us!', ""It's murder on my street, your street, back streets"", 'Wall Street, corporate offices', 'Banks, employees, and bosses with', ""Homicidal thoughts;

 You got a knot in your chest, imagine how a knife hurts
 You stabbed Un over some records
 Your excuse was ""He was talkin' too reckless!""","On December 2, 1999, Jay made an appearance at a release party in New York City for Q-Tip’s debut album Amplified. Also in attendance was Lance “Un” Rivera, a record producer and close friend of The Notorious B.I.G.

At the time, Jay was preparing to release his fourth studio album, Vol. 3… Life and Times of S. Carter, on December 28th. Allegations that Lance Rivera helped bootleg Jay’s unreleased album a month before its release date were circulating all throughout the hip-hop world.

When Jay and his crew discovered one of the supposed bootleggers was at the same nightclub, a physical altercation ensued, which resulted in a stabbing that sent Lance Rivera to the hospital. The following day, Jay admitted to being the perpetrator and turned himself in. He was facing 15 years in prison for the alleged stabbing, but was instead given three years of probation.



These lines are very different from the way Jay has rapped about the stabbing incident in the past. For example, on “Dear Summer” Jay rapped:

Counting is a major motif in “Hamilton” and several songs feature a count, including the next song (“Satisfied”) where Eliza’s sister counts to three, “Ten Duel Commandments,” “Take a Break,” “Blow Us All Away,” and of course “The World Was Wide Enough.” There is even a mini-count in this song–“one week later… two weeks later…” Hamilton is constantly counting down to the end of his life.

 Nobody pray for me
 It's been that day for me
 Waaaaay (Yeah, yeah!)","Video Intro:

Wicked or weakness?
You gotta see this
Waaaaay (Yeah, yeah!)

Kendrick evokes religious imagery—he calls out for everyone to gather around him, much like a preacher does, and he even dresses like a pope in the music video.



The theme “wicked or weakness” is first heard on the intro track, “BLOOD.,” where Kendrick implores his listeners to determine whether his actions or the actions of his opponents are a sign of wickedness or weakness.

On “XXX.,” Kendrick has a friend who requests prayer after a fucked up day:

He said: “K.Dot, can you pray for me?
It’s been a fucked up day for me

“Nobody pray for me,” is likely a proclamation, rather than a command. On “ELEMENT.,” Kendrick says:

 Pistol in your hand don't make you real","Cole revisits a prominent theme from his 2018 album KOD. Throughout the project, he attempts to replicate the inner conscious of an addict. For instance, on “The Cut Off” he says:

Gimme drink, gimme dope
Bottom line, I can’t cope

On “Motiv8,” he repeats:

I’m crackin' a smile, I’m dyin' inside
My demons are close, I’m tryin' to hide
I’m poppin' a pill, I’m feelin' alive
I’m feelin' alive, I’m feelin' alive

Cole feels that many of the youth turn to temporary, materialistic things in an effort to feel a sense of fulfillment, which connects to the outro of the song.

Continuing with the message of the track, Cole begins his usual style of a simple storytelling, but then he switches to autotune on the chorus—which is something Cole has rarely or never used in the past.

2090,And they blame it on Marilyn,"It has been reported by the students of the Columbine Shooting that the ones who shot up the school (Eric Harris & Dylan Klebold) were fans of American rock band, Marilyn Manson (though this was later proven to be false.)

Since Rock & Roll was introduced to the world, there has always been the theory that music can persuade the type of violent behavior these students committed. The band has been known for it’s arguably reckless, eerie behavior, so it’s no surprise that the public eye held Manson responsible.

It is also possible that this lyric has a much deeper meaning, criticizing the media. When something as horrid as a school shooting occurs, people are quick to point fingers at controversial music artists such as Marilyn Manson or Eminem himself, for influencing a crime that’s completely indirect to them.

Eminem mentioned something similar to this on his song “Who Knew.”

 I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
 I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it","Acting “out of pocket” is a figurative English idiom meaning to act wild and out of control. It is analogous to the expression “out of line.”

Lamar couples the figurative “pocket” with the literal “pocket” in order to say that people have been acting out of control and concerned about money (“tappin' they pockets”)—speculating that a cause is the “who is the greatest rapper” debate, suggesting it should stop.

Lamar has explictly asserted his position as the greatest. He has also expressed concerns about money and his own behavior post celebrity. In the context of To Pimp A Butterfly and DAMN., these lines may be directed both externally (toward others) and internally (toward himself).

 Hanging 'round these rappers cause they dumb as shit","If Cole did go back to university, people would wonder why. The girl would say “Don’t you know this shit already?” because he already graduated (from St. John’s University, Magna Cum Laude). She would say “Nigga ain’t you rich already?” because he has already made it in the rap game. She thinks he should already know the material and should be focusing on his rap career.

He claims that hanging around with rappers has made him dumb. It’s a prejudice that most rappers are uneducated, but the fact is that Cole is one of only few rappers with a college degree. He feels like having lost the knowledge and intellect he had gained from graduating college, which is why in recent interviews you hear Cole say “I’m going back to college” with the intention to get smarter.

He certainly also understands getting smarter as an opportunity to enhance his lyrical abilities. He wants to write more songs with “smart” and “real” lyrics, instead of songs with “dumb” messages like “Work Out” only to sell records.

 My skin is too thick and bulletproof to touch me","Thick skin : The ability to withstand criticism and show no signs of any criticism you may receive getting to you..

His self esteem is so high (shooting through the roof) that its gotten his skin thickness to be bullet proof. He is in other words, way too confident for shabby criticism to even touch him. Notice the gun theme with the play on “shooting through the roof” and “bullet proof”. Could also link to the previous tool theme as a firearm is in slang also referred to as tool.

While the pauses in between the words may seem a bit odd, there is a possibility of there being further meaning in these splits. By cutting the word esteem and bullet and only taking the second syllable which runs smoothly with the rest of the lyrics,we can make more sense of the pauses.

3278,"A beacon of hope, put a B-I-R-D in the air","Similar to a “wing and a prayer,” a “beacon of hope” is a notion used for something that sets a positive precedent – in this case, Eminem was the beacon of hope for young and emerging rappers, particularly those who were white, or wanted to rap about more sensitive, controversial topics.

Eminem could be referring to the concept of “flipping the bird” more commonly noted as giving the finger or more specifically, the middle one. This gesture would be indicative of Eminem putting the bird in the air to all those who doubted him, his legacy and/or undermined his global reach.

Yet, Cole recognizes, like all new parents, that as a father in certain situations he will have to put his daughter’s well being above his own.

James McMillan Jr. is mentioned not only in this song but at the end of changes where Jermaine reminisced on when he found out that his friend had died.

Jermaine describes a vivid memory within this verse about his last conversation with James before he died at the age of 22, when he tells him about how he wasn’t given enough time to make his amends but praises his only daughter as his greatest accomplishment.

2103,Wasn’t the trouble with much of our previous government size?,"This refers to the British Empire, which was the government Jefferson and the other revolutionaries previously lived under. In terms of literal size, the British Empire was known for nearly overtaking the populated surface of the planet at one point in time, and administration of that vast population was difficult to oversee. It might also refer to the British government itself, which was heavily bureaucratic and often needlessly complicated and insular.

Madison is also betraying a bit of his Democratic Republican bias here, as his party was more in favor of a decentralized government that gave more power to the citizens and states and less power to the federal government. Seeing Federalists like Hamilton propose these huge federal-level undertakings would have sent a chill down his spine.

545,Teamed up with the CCA,"Today, there are more African-American adults under correctional control than were enslaved in 1850, before the Civil War.

The explosion in the size of our prison population over the last 40 years rakes in billions of dollars a year for CCA and other for-profit prison companies. The United States has built up the highest incarceration rate of any country in the world, with over 2.3 million men and women living behind bars. This is a historical anomaly; despite relatively stable incarceration rates earlier in the twentieth century, our prison population grew by 700% between 1970 and 2005, far outpacing both crime and general population growth.

And this overincarceration epidemic has a massive and disproportionate impact on people of color. If current trends continue, 1 in 3 Black men born today can expect to serve time behind bars.

As reported by CNN:

Between 2005 and April 2017, 80 officers have been arrested on murder or manslaughter charges for on-duty shootings. During that 12-year span, 35% were convicted, while the rest were pending or not convicted.

More specifically, regarding Freddie Gray, referenced earlier in the song:

Three of the six officers involved were acquitted of all charges, including one of murder. Prosecutors also dropped all charges against three other officers, ending one of the most closely watched and unsuccessful police prosecutions in the nation.

Instead, Cole largely wrote from the perspective of a dead friend, whom he gave the fictional name of James in the interest of protecting the privacy of his family.

Throughout the song and early in the album, Cole expresses from the perspective of James a feeling of inevitable demise inspired by the precarious life he felt he had no choice but to lead. In the end, James asks only that Cole preserve and tell his story to his daughter if he really should meet his untimely demise.

Unfortunately, as Cole reveals on “Change”, James' life is violently cut short, and Cole fulfills his wish to tell his story to his daughter by writing this album. Thus, the album is truly not written to really be understood or consumed by his fans or critics, but instead, for James' daughter, or as he expresses it, “For your eyes

 But I can't seem to fight this urge to make you feel pain
 I know that vengeance is the Lord's and it's not for me","Struggling with the thought of this person not facing the consequences for their actions, but also not being able to bear the thought of murdering them, Cole references Romans 12:19, how he shouldn’t be worried about vengeance.

19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, “Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord.”

Rather, he should be more focused on repaying this person with love and blessing, as commanded to in 1 Peter 3:9:

9 Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.

In an interview with No Jumper, Cole shared his thoughts about religion, particularly Christianity, and some of his experiences with faith throughout his life:

It hit a point where I had to question it for the first time. I felt bad about it. I felt guilty …for even having a negative thought about it. I went and got baptized, started reading The Bible, and I was scared as fuck. Then it hit a point in my life where I just fell off and said, “I’ll let the answer come.” As I got older, I felt like I got a personal understanding of what God is to me, a strong belief too.

This is not the first time Cole has talked about God in his music, talking about it in songs such as “Change.”

Most niggas don’t believe in God and so they terrified
It’s either that or they be fearing they gon' go to Hell
Asking the Father for forgiveness, got ‘em overwhelmed (Please, God, I want to go to Heaven)

Also mentioning “the Lord” on “Love Yourz.”

Husbands are also sometimes compared to rocks, as the backbone of the traditional family unit.

The melody and phrasing of the song’s hook, especially this section, and particularly Beyoncé’s intonation on the word “Roc”, bare many similarities to the melody and lyrics of the traditional American spiritual “Sinnerman”, made perhaps most famous by Nina Simone.

2452,I’ll write my way out…,"This line is important in its own right, as it can both show a bit of Hamilton’s character and talent. The poor boy has been through so much, from his parents leaving him (both either on purpose or because of death) to a hurricane that destroyed nearly everything.

   One, he’s trying to recreate the miracle that got him out of the hopeless situation that got him to the place in society he is in right now. He’s essentially saying: “Hey! Look! I’m good at writing so I should be excused for cheating on my wife, it’s all good!”

   However, this method doesn’t work, as the last hurricane he was in wasn’t his own fault. He used his wit and talent to get out of it, he’s trying to use the same strategy to make his way out of the metaphorical “hurricane” he created. He wrote down honesty both times. First, honesty with his feelings, second, honesty with the situation. Telling everyone you cheated on your wife won’t get you out of your metaphorical hurricane.

   Two, he’s showing his character off. He is stubborn. Stubborn beyond belief. Even with everyone in the back of his mind telling him to calm down, to let it go, that his mistakes will be recorded, and that he should just learn when to be patient.

   The woman he loves, a member of her family which he claimed to care about, the very woman that had to put up with the person who turned him into a scandal, and one of the last people he could have called a friend if he tried to fix their relationship all telling him to just calm down. Even when the rest of the company joins in, he still does nothing. He does nothing to listen to them.

Additionally, this line employs a level of misdirection in the sense that the audience has indeed met Jefferson in a more concrete sense through the actor playing him, Daveed Diggs, who plays Marquis de Lafayette in the first act. In an interview with Charlie Rose, Diggs explains the double casting:

It was conceived that way. Lin always said that it was because we had to meet these people fresh in the second act so you want to hopefully have the audience have already fallen in love with the actor so you don’t have to build up a relationship with the new character.

Instead, they are content to sit back and watch him unravel, claiming it’s just part of his “genius.” Ye seems to recognize this himself, as The Life of Pablo had songs like “Real Friends” and

She actually was talking about a hearing aid in that audio. She was talking about a hearing aid and how she can’t find anything to satisfy her. My mom was like, ‘You need a f*cking hearing aid,’ and Nonna was like, ‘I can’t! I don’t like it! I can’t find something to satisfy me!’ My mom was driving her crazy, so that’s what that audio is about. I was like, ‘This kind of applies to my life, so I’m just gonna stick it at the beginning of 'Bloodline.’

Grande is likely employing her grandma’s vocals here to express her own disinterest in long-term relationships. thank u, next is largely about her recovery after losing ex Mac Miller to an overdose in September 2018, and her failed engagement with comedian Pete Davidson.

 I'm dreaming violent, I can't tolerate disloyalty","J. Cole is known to shy from the spot light. He isn’t the type to flare up in response to another rapper dissing him, in an interview with New York Times, Cole said

For so long my mind state was, I have to show how much better than the next man I am through these bars. Who’s the best? Let me prove it. And it’s just like, damn, I’m really feeding into a cycle of keeping black people down, I’m really feeding into that.

Though this may have changed on another track from this album, 1985 ( intro to the “Fall off”), where he allegedly responds to rapper Lil' Pump’s disses toward Cole

 When Cole says he can’t tolerate disloyalty, he can also mean his step dad cheating as mentioned on “Once an Addict”.

However, despite X having a net worth of $2 million, he still can’t find the remedy for his broken heart, which is probably why he doesn’t even finish the word “alright” here.  As most of us know by now, this song, like many others, is likely alluding to his ex-girlfriend Geneva Ayala, who cheated on him and accused him of assaulting her.  X is trying to find a way to recover from the heartbreak she caused him.

In the first and only verse of this song, X says:

I’m sadder than most of y'all with the money and the freedom, nigga
What is money really worth if it ain’t love?

These lines only show that money isn’t making X happy–he needs love.

He has since moved on to Mark Pitts, who has managed Biggie and Nas, and now also manages Miguel, who’s collaborated with Cole on “All I Want is You” and “Power Trip”.

Mark seems to respect Cole for his artistry and personal qualities. He had this to say:

I was going to stop managing hip-hop. I’d been through so much, from Big to Shyne to Nas. But J.Cole brought me back. It wasn’t just how he was an artist.

1882,See,"Whoops, we already did some “see” rhymes in this song, didn’t we?

By this point, you might be getting the sense that poor King George is not very good at this music-writing thing. The rhyme scheme in this song is mostly very simple: pairs of (mostly long) lines with short rhyming words at the end. These rhymes are straightforward and mostly monosyllabic: “say”/“pay”, “cry”/“by”, “sad”/“mad”. In fact, all of the language George uses is simple and straightforward; “estrangement” is the most difficult word. When properly punctuated, the lyrics are at roughly a fourth-grade reading level.

George only has one line with internal rhymes, and those rhymes are defective in two ways. Firstly, the “tea”/“sea” rhyme is actually appropriated from Alexander Hamilton in “Farmer Refuted”, who also used it in a far more sophisticated way to discuss the Boston Tea Party (“Why should a tiny island across the sea regulate the price of tea?”)

Cole is speaking on the laziness of the current rap scene with the rise of mumble rappers and trap music in recent years whose subject matter is strictly drugs, women, and money. Notice how he enunciates the word lackadaisical incorrectly as if to make him sound lazy and uncaring like trap rappers do when they mispronounce words.

Cole would express almost identical thoughts on KOD’s final track, “1985 (Intro to the ‘Fall Off’)”:

Now you scramblin' and hopin' to get hot again
But you forgot you only popped ‘cause you was ridin’ trends
Now you old news and you goin' through regrets
‘Cause you never bought that house, but you got a Benz
And a bunch of jewels and a bunch of shoes
And a bunch of fake friends, I ain’t judgin’ you

First, Eminem makes a play on the expression “[to] nod off.” “Nodding off” is an expression for falling asleep, as the head slowly droops as someone loses consciousness, mimicking a slow nod. It’s noteworthy that nodding along to a beat doesn’t necessarily mean that one’s eyes are closed.

Additionally, Em claims that he doesn’t even close his eyes when he sneezes. Most people close their eyes when they sneeze as an automatic reflex.

 The way I fixed your heart, oh","In “Call Out My Name”, The Weeknd admitted to both him and Selena being scarred and broken:

We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place

The Weeknd helped her by — though being callous himself– loving her and in a way, fixing her heart instead of suffering.

“Kissing one’s scars” has a double meaning. It means that he loved her and accepted her “true colors” and for who she is—he comforted her emotional scars. Additionally, this could mean that Abel kissed Selena’s literal scars that she received after her kidney transplant surgery to treat her Lupus diagnosis.



This may also be referring to a similar lyric from one of Tesfaye’s previous songs, “As You Are”:

2387,A system he can shape however he wants,"Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison participated in one of the first documented occasions of “log rolling”, where votes are exchanged in Congress between two legislators – or the quid pro quo (“something for something” in Latin) that Madison mentions later in the song.

Specifically, the Dinner Compromise of 1790 negotiations lead to Madison lending support to pass the Funding Act of 1790 and Hamilton lending support to move the capital to somewhere along the Potomac to the current location, Washington D.C..

The Funding Act of 1790 essentially allowed the national government to take in and manage state debts. Northern states, which were in a numerable amount of debt, favored the plan because it would alleviate their debts. Southern states were not in as much debt due to their profitable agrarian industry and felt outrage towards the act because they, in short, would be paying for the Northern states debts if the act was to pass.

1742,"You was never gang, gang, gang, gang, you was never one of us
 Had us fooled for a minute there, now we done all grown up
 But I’m better off anyway, y’all never gon’ finish Drake","Drake uses the Scarborough slang “Gang, gang, gang, gang,” which is chanted in repetition to depict how close knit of a crew you are, while  borrowing Tory Lanez’s flow of repeating words in his verses to add emphasis. He does this on his single “B.L.O.W.:”

Hate to be the reason
Why your dream bitches never get to see ya
Never, ever, ever, ever, ever
Me forever, ever, ever, ever, ever?

In an interview with HipHopDX back in 2014, Tory spoke about how Drake helped to put Toronto on the map and the influence he had on the growth of his music:

I feel like in Toronto, we’ve always tried to have a particular sound, and I feel like Drake happened to be one of the dudes that paved that sound. […] I feel like [Drake has] helped me piece my sound together, and I feel like subconsciously, as an artist, you’re gonna take certain things from what you hear on a day-to-day basis.

However, once Drake got bigger and started separating himself from his Toronto peers, artists like Tory started to show dislike. Drake noticed this and realized Tory’s true feelings towards him. It goes to show that Drake will stick to his “No New Friends” policy and focus on his business.

Associate turned enemy Quentin Miller claimed this line was directed at him, responding his own track “unHoly:”

2783,My city love me like Mac Dre in the Bay,"Mac Dre is a legendary rapper representing the city of Vallejo in the northern region of the San Francisco Bay Area. From maintaining his status as an independent artist throughout his career and recording albums from a prison pay phone to being a pioneer of the Thizz Movement and personification of the Hyphy Movement prior to his passing in 2004, Mac Dre had a major impact on the substance and style of the Bay Area hip-hop culture—as Bay Area rapper G-Eazy discussed in a 2014 interview with HipHopDX:

Mac Dre means everything to Hip-Hop in the Bay. Mac Dre is more than a legend. He just had such a big like catalog of these mixtapes and albums. He had so much music. So it was like, when Mac Dre really, really, really caught on, which was around the time he died unfortunately, that was when everyone really got swept up into it. He was the biggest force in the Bay.

Drake also paid respect to Dre on “The Motto,” which appears later in the Take Care tracklist—in 2016, Dre’s mom told Rolling Stone how these shout-outs inspired her to make a documentary on her son’s life:

I met with Drake in San Francisco and we sat down and he talked with me about how Mac Dre impacted his life and his career, what he’s doing and the big impact that Mac Dre had when Drake was a young boy. So listening to that, it kind of opened up my eyes that maybe I do need to do this. If Andre was alive he would definitely be capitalizing and making as much money as he could.

Whether it be Toronto City Councillors supporting Drake during the beef he had with Meek Mill, or Toronto radio stations playing him more than any other artist, Toronto always gives love back to Drake—just like Bay Area hip-hop fans supported Mac Dre.

Achieve (here pronounced atchee) is also a sneezing noise.

Translation:


Leave the girls alone
Leave the girls alone
[or] One day it’ll be you they will leave
Leave the girls alone
Leave the girls alone
[or] One day it’ll be you they will leave

Yes, I cried, but on that day
No, I won’t cry
No, I won’t cry
Yes, I cried, but on that day
No, I won’t cry
No, I won’t cry


You should forget the girls, because one day they will forget you. He’s cried before, but now he’s cold to that kind of thing.

Stop playing with those girls' hearts, because one day, a girl that you truly love will play with yours. That day, the girl you tricked won’t cry, she will be rather happy that you’ve had a taste of your own medicine.

Meaning of the original song, written by Serge Gainsbourg:

The phrase “I’m not at ease” may refer to the title of a Chinua Achebe novel, No Longer at Ease, about a young British-educated Nigerian man whose family opposes his marriage to the love of his life because of traditional taboos.

The fact that he has reached such a low means that he cannot be hurt more than he already has been. He feels as if since his heart was broken, he has been completely desensitised and is numb to pain.

The fact that his “heart’s been broke” is symbolised with a tattoo of a broken heart below his left eye, and the fact he has become numb is symbolised with one below his right eye. He touches on this numb stage in his life in his “No Jumper” interview.

632,"Die for what you believe, only one god recedes
 When the shots spray, spray, spray","Death for a higher power is equivalent to death for any cause, maybe for a country, an organization, or a belief: in any case, people are willing to lay their life on the line for abstract concepts. Like the Christian post-hardcore band Thrice said in their song “Like Moths to Flame.”

I nod but don’t know what to say
But I know you
And I believe you’re who you say you are so
I will follow you, lay down my life
I would die for you, this very night

Here, there are two possible meanings.

When Jay says, “Only one God recedes when the shots spray” (bullets fire), he could be referring to himself, the “god in the flesh,” JayHova. He is more pragmatic, rather than idealistic; as the partition in an earlier lyric implies, he keeps a respectful distance from whatever belief system he subscribes to. He isn’t willing to take a bullet for an abstract concept, the archetypal “survivor.”

On the other hands, he might be saying that your god will recede when the shots spray, in your final moments of life. You might reconsider offering up your life to that higher power that was apparently unable to save you when you needed it/Him most.

Another idea is that he’s referring to money. Money is a god to many, and it’s the only god that becomes less important when the shots spray (in the face of death). You can’t take it with you. Belief (knowledge, wisdom, freedom, and understanding) is what you should try to amass before death, and Jay alludes to that in the opening lines of the song.",5,False,accepted,179061,Heaven,Heaven by JAY-Z (Ft. Justin Timberlake),41,604704,8,"['Have you ever been to heaven?', 'Have you ever seen the gates?', 'Have you bowed unto your highness?', 'And do you know how heaven taste?

2567,"My expertise checked out in second grade
 When I was 9, on cell, motel, we didn't have nowhere to stay
 At 29, I've done so well, hit cartwheel in my estate","Kendrick was 29 years old when he released DAMN.. At age 9, just after graduating from second grade, Kendrick was living in motels, near Section 8 housing. Back on the bonus song ‘'County Building Blues’' of his 2012 album Good Kid M.a.a.d City he told us about these struggles:

I’ve been waiting on this day since Dr. Dre and Pac
Was on Rosecrans in that burgerstand at ‘95
People staring at 'em in amazement
Reservations at the Days Inn
We was living out a hotel at the time

But 20 years later, he’s ecstatic that his success has allowed him to own property. In 2014, he bought a house is Eastvale, California worth $500,000—a modest price for a wealthy rapper.

Kendrick spoke of his success at the age of 29 on his feature for Isaiah Rashad’s “Wat’s Wrong”:

3269,You wanted Shady? You got him!,"“Slim Shady” is Eminem’s alter ego portrayed by him in his earlier songs. Many critics and listeners to Eminem’s most recent album “Revival” did not like its songs, marking it as “his worst album ever” and demanding the old Slim Shady to be back, hence asking for Eminem to go back to his old style. Em acknowledges and further responds to this in “The Ringer”:

But last week, an ex-fan mailed me a copy
Of The Mathers LP to tell me to study
It’ll help me get back to myself and she’ll love me (ooouuu)
I mailed the bitch back and said if I did that
I’d just be like everyone else in the fucking industry
Especially an effing Recovery clone of me (didn’t I think)

Also, this line goes back to his track “GOAT” in which he states:

 Whistling","The guitar strum and whistling both come from Paul McCartney’s “Two-Finger Chord & Whistle”. Paul wrote this song after viewing a print of Pablo Picasso’s The Old Guitarist while in the hospital for the birth of his second child, Mary.

Cheeky Cole, also in stark contrast to the rapper he is competeing with and also mentioned in the song, Kanye West.

It can also be read in the hip-hop sense. MCs in hip-hop use “what” as a way of amping up a song; it’s like saying “I can’t hear you” to get a crowd or rapper to be louder.

2489,"You makin' him nervous, the music is loud","Kayla Duckworth, Kendrick’s sister, voices this line. She also appeared at the end of 2015’s “Black Friday.”

Kendrick uses this line to give his dad a shoutout. When he was a newborn baby on his way home from the hospital, his dad was blasting Big Daddy Kane in the car, and his mother asked him to turn it down. His dad refused and said the loud music is good for him. Kendrick is attributing his skills and success in the music industry to his early exposure.

She’s also haunted by past relationships: conducting her private life in public means that anyone can quickly learn her tumultuous dating history. She was married to basketball player Kris Humphries for 72 days, and her sex tape with singer Ray J was leaked in 2007.  Kim cited the decision to make a sex tape and televising her wedding and marriage to Humphries as two of her biggest regrets.

2702,"Took me too long for this song, I don't deserve you
 I harassed you out in Paris
 ""Please come back to Rome,"" you make it home","JAY-Z and Beyoncé, who have been together some fifteen years, often find themselves under the lens of the world media, and their relationship has regularly been beset by allegations of trouble and infidelity. This famously came to a head in 2016 when Beyoncé released her album Lemonade, which appeared to contain numerous references to her husbands alleged adultery.

Hov seems to confirm his infidelity here and numerous other times throughout 4:44. In the spirit of reconciliation, he concedes that it has taken him too long to offer his apologies—after all, the album dropped just over a year after Lemonade.

His references to Paris and Rome, both European capitals, underline the hectic, jet-setting lifestyle of a power couple made up of two of the planet’s biggest and most successful musical stars. It’s unlikely he is actually asking Beyoncé to join him in Rome, though. Instead, he may be indicating his longing for the strength he feels when he is happy and has his wife by his side; Rome is the historic centre of the Roman Empire, which seemed limitless in its

2885,"And still put hands on you
 Stayin' wound up is how I spend time (Get it?)","Em starts a triple entendre here with “still put hands on you”.


The last thing you’re likely to add to a snowman would be some sticks for arms then some mittens or gloves for hands.
Before, Em makes a reference to beef (ground beef). Now he will “put hands on you""— common slang term for hitting someone—but specifically, he ""put[s] hands on you” in the way someone puts their hands on round chuck, when making burgers.
Watches have hands put on the face to tell the time. Hereafter, he starts a larger play on words about time.



“Stayin' wound up is how I spend time” goes with the time reference, and is also a triple entendre.


There are watches that, instead of running off of a battery, have a wind up mechanism.
“Wound up” is a common phrase meaning tense, anxious or fidgety. Em spends his time being wound up, or restless and anxious.
“Spend” is a homophone for “spin”. A watch being wound up is what makes the hands spin. In other words, the mechanism being wound up spins time.",47,False,accepted,3350675,Believe,Believe by Eminem,38,796129,0,"['And I started from the bottom', 'Like a snowman—ground-up', 'Like round

 Kendrick Lamar, make some noise, brother","This hype man is Ronald Isley, a member of the Isley Brothers. He was first heard on the intro of the version of “i” that was released on TDE’s SoundCloud page in September 2014, but deleted shortly after the song was released as an official single on iTunes. He also appears on the music video. The intro below was cut from the iTunes version, unfortunately, but it does fit with the message of Kendrick’s album.

We got a young brother that stands for something! / We got a young brother that believes in the all of us! / Brother Kendrick Lamar! He’s not a rapper, he’s a writer, he’s an author! / And if you read between the lines, we’ll learn how to love one another! / But you can’t do that — right on! — I said, you can’t do that without loving yourself first.

These words foreshadow what we find out to be one of the central themes of To Pimp a Butterfly: Kendrick doesn’t want to be portrayed (or perceived) as a rapper or associated with the lifestyle thereof; rather, he wants to set an example by standing up for what he believes in, and give positive energy to all who hear his music.

Additionally, one of the most important phrases in Isley’s lines on this track is, “He done travelled all over the world. He came back to give you some game.” This reveals that Kendrick is apparently back in his hometown, Compton, giving this performance, which gives more importance and meaning to the fight that breaks out in the show and what Kendrick tells the crowd to calm them. Kendrick is doing what he talked about in “Another Nigga,” the poem running through the whole album:

 Ayy, ayy, I'ma fuck around and make you my bitch","In 2016, Kanye parted ways with Nike to work with Adidas who agreed to offer him “full creative reign.” And in 2018, Kanye claims that his Yeezy brand now pulls in more money for Adidas than Jordan’s do for Nike, while this is unconfirmed, Adidas did rake in $2.7 billion more in sales than Nike for the 2017 fiscal year.

Drake was rumored to be collaborating with Adidas at the time of this song’s release. This didn’t sit well with Kanye, since Drake has sang his praises for Nike in songs like “Schemin' Up,” where he says:

I ran the game so long I should be wearing Dri-Fit

Dri-Fit is a fabric popularized by Nike to help enhance an athlete’s performance by blocking moisture. “Dry snitching” is a way of tattling indirectly to seem innocent. It’s considered even sneakier than snitching.

All Drake mentions aside, these lines could also allude to when someone on Kanye’s team repurposed a sketch that artist Tony Spackman made while he was at Nike. When Spackman spoke up, Ye had to fire the designer. Since then, however, Kanye has accused Nike of copying his Yeezy designs.

1543,There are so many to deflower!,"We all know what Burr has on his mind…



In 1860, an anonymous author actually published a sexually explicit biography of Aaron Burr—The Amorous Adventures of Aaron Burr. The book, though undoubtedly highly fictionalized, details a number of his alleged sexual conquests.

This would be fine if Burr, like Drake, lived in the modern world, where he would be free to please as many ladies as would have him. However, by 18th century standards, there’s a bit more going on here.

When Burr is talking about deflowering, he’s literally talking about taking away a woman’s virginity. While pre-marital sex was not exactly verboten in the 18th century—about one-third of colonial brides were pregnant on their wedding days—a lady was expected to marry the man who got her in the family way. If a woman’s chastity was lost, whether it was through a consensual act or rape, her reputation could be ruined.

As women weren’t easily able to retain property or businesses, most had to rely on their husbands or, more tentatively, their fathers and brothers to provide for her income. Thus, if a young woman lost her reputation and became unable make an advantageous marriage, her whole livelihood could be threatened. The higher the class, the more important it was that a woman’s chastity was preserved, as such a girl would not have been brought up to make any contingency plans for her future.

Basically, Burr and his crew can joke all they want, but for women, the act of courtship was a deadly serious business.",51,False,accepted,2314564,A Winter's Ball,A Winter's Ball by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,20,635683,0,"['How does the bastard, orphan, son of a whore', 'Go on and on', 'Grow into more of a phenomenon?', 'Watch this obnoxious, arrogant, loudmouth bother', 'Be seated at the right hand of the father', 'Washington hires Hamilton right on sight', 'But Hamilton still wants to fight, not write', 'Now Hamilton’s skill with a quill is undeniable', 'But what do we have in common?

I made sure that everything he had a beat for, I had a rhyme ready to go, or I came up with a rhyme on the spot.

“My Name Is” was the first thing that came out of my mouth that first day I was at Dre’s house. I don’t know if we released what I did the first day or if I re-did it, but it was basically the same. I didn’t understand punching, or believe in it. So I would just go from the top of the song all the way down. I was never flying in hooks. Everything was live, one take. If I got all the way to the fucking end, and messed up the last word, I’d be like “Run it back, let’s do it again.” I remember Dre was like “Yo, are you fucking crazy? Let’s just punch.” I didn’t like that concept because I wasn’t used to it. When we were recording here in Detroit, in the beginning, I was saving up my money to go in. We only had an hour, you know?

 Monsieur Hamilton
 
 
 Monsieur Lafayette","Since Lafayette is from France, he would naturally call Hamilton “Monsieur.” This is the French equivalent of “Mister,” with a respectful connotation of “sir.”

The line is said in a bit of a mocking tone, as Lafayette is gently teasing his friend about his recent rise in station. Hamilton archly responds in kind, because he is a gentleman!

Hilariously, they’re both addressing each other wrong. Hamilton should rightfully be “Lt. Col. Hamilton” and Lafayette should of course be Marquis de Lafayette. Lafayette wasn’t even his actual last name, just his title! By English naming standards, he’d need to be Monsieur du Motier! In the French, he’d more rightfully be Monsieur le Marquis de Lafayette, or just Monsieur le Marquis. Aristocrats! What can you do?

As in “Farmer Refuted,” “The Room Where It Happens,” and “Your Obedient Servant,” these little moments of sarcasm provide some levity for the audience in the play’s calm-before-the-storm moments (“Farmer Refuted” quickly turns violent after Hamilton mocks Seabury, a ferocious battle starts after Hamilton and Lafayette end their conversation, the hectic compromise emerges after Hamilton and Burr’s friendly conversation in “The Room Where it Happens,” and we all know what happens after “Your Obedient Servant”).",27,False,accepted,2314665,Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down),Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down) by Original Broadway Cast of Hamilton,51,1347463,1,"['The battle of Yorktown. 1781', 'Monsieur Hamilton', 'Monsieur Lafayette', 'In command where you belong', 'How you say, no sweat', ""We're finally on the field.

The Jordans are only popular at this point because of two people — me and Don C. Because Don C was ordering them vintage Jordans when the IVs used to break apart at the sole.

3009,"Girl, why can't you wait? (why can't you wait, baby?)
 Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?","Abel could be referring to his breakup with Selena Gomez: shortly after they broke up, she started dating her ex, Justin Bieber; not giving Abel enough time to get over the relationship.

On the other hand, Abel was spotted leaving Bella Hadid’s apartment–who he dated previous to Gomez–shortly after, indicating that maybe he didn’t need much time after all.

These lines also call back to Thursday, where he sings on “The Birds (Part 2)”:

She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her

The Birds (Part 2) by was released roughly 6 years before this song. Back then, the Weeknd would  describe himself as somewhat emotionless and would disregard the slightest chances of having a serious relationship. He’d hint that women would be foolish to fall in love with him due to these personality traits. When used in comparison with the current track, a significant change in Abel’s life and his ways is depicted.

The tables have definitely turned since his Thursday mix-tape, in the most ironic of ways. He now finds himself in love with someone, begging her not to leave. He asks her to stay a little longer in order to ease the pain of her future departure, much as the woman on The Birds (Part 2) asked him years ago.

As painful as this may be for him, it does portray his emotional growth in relation to woman.

2555,"Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth!","Kid Capri also dropped this line on “ELEMENT.”  It’s an adaption of the phrase “what happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,” but also alludes to the Bible verse 1 Timothy 6:7:

For we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out.

Kid Capri also annotated this line on “ELEMENT.,” saying:

To tell the truth, I never asked Kendrick the meaning of it. I said what I said and I never asked him the meaning. He told me to say that part.

The most interesting detail about this line is that Kendrick considered titling the album “What Happens on Earth Stays on Earth,” as stated in an interview with Big Boy.

3256,Steering clear of any headaches to start,"Ariana avoids certain subjects or situations that could cause conflict i.e. headaches, between her and her partner. She finds herself walking on eggshells and not being completely truthful, in order to avoid angering her significant other.

Alternatively, this may be a reference to Ariana’s stance post-relationship. She wants to make it clear that she is in no place for a boyfriend or any commitment – as referred to later in the song she is better off being free. She is looking to avoid any drama or stress that a toxic relationship may bring.

3004,"I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied","Abel is notorious for his sexual escapades. He has not only spoken about his sexual prowess but also how detached he is in sexual situations and relationships. This physical-emotional detachment has been a constant theme in his music since his first mixtape, House of Balloons, and essentially facilitated the underlying plot of his second mixtape Thursday. This is almost as consistent and ever-present as allusions to his myriad drug-fueled adventures.

However in “Adaptation” he demonstrates a self-awareness and desire for a meaningful feeling involved relationship:

Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun

So while he likely warned her that he was trouble along the lines of his famous line from “The Zone”:

I can’t feel a damn thing

At his core, Abel does have a capacity to love. So despite saying he didn’t harbor any real feelings towards her, as he admits, he lied.

This isn’t the first time Abel has boasted about lying either, on “Montreal” he boasts how it comes natural to him,

Now that The Weeknd is a well-known artist, he has nowhere to hide. He used to be untraceable and now is on every single social media. Abel feels that this 180-degree change in his life has put him in a delicate position, where he doesn’t feel comfortable.

628,In the land of the killers a sinner's mind is a sanctum,"Eminem admits that he is far from perfect. He raps about rape and violence, and has a long list of legal troubles. But despite all that, he has never been affiliated with a gang or participated in gun violence. So in a genre that is becoming more and more influenced by the gang-banging lifestyle, Eminem claims that his music is actually becoming the lesser of two evils. Normally the mind of a sinner would be thought of as a dark and dangerous place, but compared to the mind of a murderer it’s preferable.

Young black pants sag, headphones blastin’
Know what he askin', “how did he manage?”

2399,Then defend it,"Combined with Hamilton’s line above, Miranda seems to be alluding to the oath of office for the United States Senate:

“I, AB, do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion, and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.”

Perhaps foreshadowing Burr’s election to the Senate, or just Hamilton poking fun at Burr for his obvious political ambitions?

However, if this is an allusion to the above oath, it is an anachronism. The original oath of office for the Senate, enacted in 1789 by the First Congress, simply read, “I, A.B. do solemnly swear or affirm (as the case may be) that I will support the Constitution of the United States.” It wasn’t until after the Civil War that oaths were made more specific, for obvious reasons. The longer oath quoted above wasn’t enacted until 1884, with a minor change in 1966.

 I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on
 And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb","Pain in this case isn’t necessarily physical, but mental. X is describing what it feels like to go through depression.

When depressed, many people feel that it takes a lot of energy just to be happy. It’s strenuous to keep yourself from breaking down and giving into your depressive thoughts.

Simultaneously, a lot of emotions are forgone and replaced by this feeling of eternal sadness. The weight of the world sits on your shoulders and makes you numb to a lot of feelings.

X describes not only the mental agony of depression, but also likely self harm, which he mentions in other songs and which many speculate he has a history of. Many (though not all) people who self harm do it because they feel emotionally and/or physically numb, and physical pain creates a tangible distraction from the mental anguish of depression; it allows people to feel something, to have some groundedness in reality, to hold on.",72,False,accepted,3185661,Jocelyn Flores,Jocelyn Flores by XXXTENTACION,13,5492442,0,"['I know you so well, so well', 'I mean, I can do anything that he can', ""I've been pretty—"", ""I know you're somewhere, somewhere"", ""I've been trapped in my mind, girl, just holding on"", ""I don't wanna pretend we're something, we're nothing"", ""I've been stuck thinking 'bout her, I can't hold on (I'll be feeling)"", ""I'm in pain, wanna put ten shots in my brain"", ""I've been trippin' 'bout some things, can't change"", ""Suicidal, same time I'm tame"", 'Picture this, in bed, get a phone call', 'Girl that you fucked with killed herself', 'That was this summer when nobody helped', 'And ever since then, man, I hate myself', ""Wanna fuckin' end it, pessimistic"", 'All wanna see me with no pot to piss in', ""But niggas been excited 'bout the grave I'm diggin'"", ""Havin' conversations 'bout my haste decisions"", ""Fuckin' sickenin'; at the same time"", 'Memories surface through the grapevine', ""'Bout my uncle playin' with a slip knot"", 'Post-traumatic stress got me fucked up', 'Been fucked up since the couple months they had a nigga locked up', ""I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on"", ""And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb"", ""I'll be feelin' pain, I'll be feelin' pain just to hold on"", ""And I don't feel the same, I'm so numb"", 'I know you so well (I know you, girl)', 'I mean, I can do better than he can', ""I've been pretty—"", 'I know you so well']",https://genius.com/14854789/Xxxtentacion-jocelyn-flores/Ill-be-feelin-pain-ill-be-feelin-pain-just-to-hold-on-and-i-dont-feel-the-same-im-so-numb-ill-be-feelin-pain-ill-be-feelin-pain-just-to-hold-on-and-i-dont-feel-the-same-im-so-numb,2,556280,19285,True,1,XXXTENTACION,396565,14854789,1.31,914,198,"[""i'll"", 'be', ""feelin'"", 'pain,', ""i'll"", 'be', ""feelin'"", 'pain', 'just', 'to', 'hold', 'on', 'and', 'i', ""don't"", 'feel', 'the', 'same,', ""i'm"", 'so', 'numb', ""i'll"", 'be', ""feelin'"", 'pain,', ""i'll"", 'be', ""feelin'"", 'pain', 'just', 'to', 'hold', 'on', 'and', 'i', ""don't"", 'feel', 'the', 'same,', ""i'm"", 'so', 'numb']","['pain', 'in', 'this', 'case', 'isn’t', 'necessarily', 'physical,', 'but', 'mental.', 'x', 'is', 'describing', 'what', 'it', 'feels', 'like', 'to', 'go', 'through', 'depression.', 'when', 'depressed,', 'many', 'people', 'feel', 'that', 'it', 'takes', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'energy', 'just', 'to', 'be', 'happy.', 'it’s', 'strenuous', 'to', 'keep', 'yourself', 'from', 'breaking', 'down', 'and', 'giving', 'into', 'your', 'depressive', 'thoughts.', 'simultaneously,', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'emotions', 'are', 'forgone', 'and', 'replaced', 'by', 'this', 'feeling', 'of', 'eternal', 'sadness.', 'the', 'weight', 'of', 'the', 'world', 'sits', 'on', 'your', 'shoulders', 'and', 'makes', 'you', 'numb', 'to', 'a', 'lot', 'of', 'feelings.', 'x', 'describes', 'not', 'only', 'the', 'mental', 'agony', 'of', 'depression,', 'but', 'also', 'likely', 'self', 'harm,', 'which', 'he', 'mentions', 'in', 'other', 'songs', 'and', 'which', 'many', 'speculate', 'he', 'has', 'a', 'history', 'of.', 'many', '(though', 'not', 'all)', 'people', 'who', 'self', 'harm', 'do', 'it', 'because', 'they', 'feel', 'emotionally', 'and/or', 'physically', 'numb,', 'and', 'physical', 'pain', 'creates', 'a', 'tangible', 'distraction', 'from', 'the', 'mental', 'anguish', 'of', 'depression;', 'it', 'allows', 'people', 'to', 'feel', 'something,', 'to', 'have', 'some', 'groundedness', 'in', 'reality,', 'to', 'hold', 'on.']",42,157

3092,I flip my misfortune and grow me a fortune,"The “misfortune” he refers to is likely the impoverished circumstances in which he was raised, as he spent part of his childhood living in a Fayetteville trailer park.  Cole discusses such an upbringing in his 2014 interview with Music Times:

There were days when my mom would have to scrape up nickels and dimes to give me $1.50 lunch money,“ Cole said. ""And I would know she wasn’t eating lunch that day so that I could.

He transformed or, “flipped” such misfortune into a fortune, as his impoverished upbringing provided him with material for his music, but it also instilled in him a hunger to overcome the odds and make it in the rap game. While Cole never actually sold drugs himself, they were all around him growing up, hence the album’s drug and addiction theme. So it’s possible the “misfortune” he refers to is not just about being broke, but about about growing up around drugs and dealers, specifically. From this perspective, “flip” refers to the buying and reselling of drugs for profit.

 You'll probably never take me back and I know this
 Yeah I know this, aw man
 I said angel, woah oh oh oh
 I'm so desensitized to feeling these emotions
 Yeah, no emotions baby","These lines parallel well to the ending of the Kiss Land narrative expressed through “Tears in the Rain,” where The Weeknd places himself in the position of the wrong-doer and the girl as the victim.

Listeners typically hear The Weeknd paint images of himself as the devilish leader that brings the women he interacts with down. Sometimes, we see these women represented as weak and easily susceptible to sin, but in cases such as here, we see the women empowered, painted as pure and above The Weeknd.

The Weeknd, knowledgeable of his sins and mistakes, has destroyed any emotions and cares that could help repair his disconnect with these angels. This leads to the repetition of the narrative.

As with much of the album, the romantic relationship can sometimes be interpreted as a metaphor for his rise to fame and change in lifestyle/image. He hopes his original fans will still relate to and love him after this change, but he fears they won’t take him back.

In the movie, B-Rabbit’s mom is a broke alcoholic who lives in a trailer with an abusive boyfriend and her daughter. Just as Eminem is protective of his daughter Hailie, Jimmy is protective of his little sister, which leads to several arguments with his mom regarding her irresponsibility as a parent.
In addition to trying to escape a broken home and poverty, Jimmy struggles greatly as a white artist trying to succeed in a predominantly black art form, reflecting Eminem’s own problems with being booed off stage during similar rap battles. With all of this pent-up rage and suffering, Jimmy angrily lashes out at Papa Doc, claiming someone as entitled as him (as Jimmy explains following these lines) could never understand the pressure and problems that Jimmy faces.",3,False,pending,49065,8 Mile: B-Rabbit vs Papa Doc,8 Mile: B-Rabbit vs Papa Doc by Eminem,22,1476596,2,"['Now, everybody from the three-one-three', 'Put your motherfucking hands up and follow me!', 'Everybody from the three-one-three', 'Put your motherfucking hands up!

 My temper is buildin', he's starin' at me, I grab my key

 Askin' for handouts, takin' it if they could
 And this particular person just had it down pat
 Starin' at me for the longest until he finally asked","Kendrick pours detail into his encounter with the homeless man throughout the majority of the second verse, leading into a climactic final verse.



The homeless man’s empty stare pierces Kendrick. He becomes intrigued and doesn’t leave. As Kendrick becomes angry at the man, he articulates emotions of disrespect, anger, confusion – comparing his anger to throwing a baseball bat at the man’s throat.

This narrative paints a metaphor that calls to mind biblical parables, such as the story of Cain and Abel (“Am I my brother’s keeper?”) and
Matthew 25:45:

Truly I tell you, whatever you did not do for one of the least of these, you did not do for me.

2998,So quick-witted,"It is at this point that Jefferson abandons any pretense of advocating for a political cause. He is no longer concerned with delivering creative rhymes or any sort of thought-out response. He devolves into vague insults that require the audience to fill in the blanks.

For example, he intones this line with bitter sarcasm, but he does not bother to explain why Hamilton’s quick wit has provoked Jefferson’s nearly audible eye-rolling. Perhaps he finds Hamilton’s latest remarks to be, in truth, foolish; he may be highlighting Hamilton’s remarkable ability to improvise excuses for moral failings; he could be jealous; or – since Hamilton’s had Washington’s favor all along – Hamilton’s metaphorical preening is needless, morally grotesque, and purely autoerotic in nature.

Scientifically, the earth orbits the Sun due to the gravitational pull of the sun. Similarly, Ariana is inexplicably drawn to Mac – and can’t simply let go of him – even if he hurts her. Interestingly, lighter objects will always orbit heavier ones which is telling in this tale of toxic relationships.

467,"What's playing in my mind, just the sound of my whole career
 Crash and burning, the thing that I mostly fear
 Was on track for the first two years until I let the Devil steer
 Now what have we here? Mask my tears, but I","In the interview below with Cole explains that he had some pretty dark thoughts while writing this album, and even suffered from depression from the pressure he faced.

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kSzPG0xMpLM&feature=youtu.be

He’s worried that Born Sinner will flop and maybe end his career.

He’s suggesting that part of the reason he’s worried is because he’s letting the Devil in him work, instead of trusting God.

On his Truly Yours 2 EP, Cole hints at the possibility of his album flopping with this line:

But I finally put my Momma in that E class, nigga
And I told her quit her job, but hold your horses
If my next album flops it’s back to the post office, both of us, shit
They’re saying that’s a real possibility
The thought alone is killing me

These lines are also a great play off the previous verse, where he’s asking the devil for his soul back. In these lines he blames the devil for nearly derailing his career, as he said it was on track until he let the devil lead the way.

Cole’s true sense of self and not being bought, whereas during the rest of the song, “running away” was associated with less principled behavior, like indulging in his unrestrained desires at the cost of cheating on his faithful woman.

This could be interpreted as him, by the end of the song, finally learning to own up to doing the noble thing
or…
it could be interpreted as him still being selfish and not compromising his self-serving behavior, even for the possibility of making 50 million dollars. It could be argued that maintaining one’s own artistic integrity is not necessarily a selfless thing. It is perhaps axiomatically selfish behavior… though that’s an argument for another time.

In all fairness, it’s likely that “running away” at this point simply refers to running away from situations that a person isn’t comfortable dealing with, like Chappelle having to continue a show that wasn’t sending the message he wanted to send or like a black slave having to take care of a child that was made through slaveowner rape. Would he have the power to run away from these situations, knowing that it’s probably practical to stay?",2,False,accepted,164422,Runaway,Runaway by J. Cole,52,684661,4,"['Married men act totally different when they\'re by themselves, don\'t they?
